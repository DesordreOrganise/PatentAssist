The EPC does not set out any formal requirements for the transfer of the priority right (see G\u00a01/22 and G\u00a02/22). Where the previous application was filed by joint applicants, all of them must be among the later European patent application's applicants or have transferred their rights in the priority application to the later European patent application's applicant (see T\u00a0844/18). Proof of the transfer can be filed later. Yet, absent any substantiated indication to the contrary, there is a strong rebuttable presumption under the EPC that an applicant or joint applicants claiming priority in accordance with Art.\u00a088(1) and Rule\u00a052 are also entitled to the claimed priority. The burden of proof is shifted, and the examining division, opponent or third party challenging an applicant's entitlement to priority has to prove that this entitlement is missing. Especially where an international application under the PCT is filed by joint applicants, including the priority applicant, but without naming the priority applicant as applicant for the European designation, the mere fact of the joint filing implies an agreement between the applicants allowing all of them to rely on the priority right unless substantial facts indicate otherwise (see G\u00a01/22 and G\u00a02/22).\nHowever, in the case of joint applicants filing the later European patent application, it is sufficient if one of the applicants is the previous application's applicant or their successor in title. There is no need for a special transfer of the priority right to the other applicant(s), since the later European patent application has been filed jointly. The same applies where the previous application itself was filed by joint applicants, provided that all of them, or their successor(s) in title, are among the later European patent application's joint applicants.\nAs concerns\u00a0(iii), the priority period starts on the day following the first application's filing date (Art.\u00a04C(2) Paris Convention and Rule\u00a0131(2)).

If the application is filed without claims or by reference to a previously filed application, the additional fee is payable within one month of filing the first set of claims or the certified copy of the application referred to in Rule\u00a040(3), whichever expires later. The additional fee is calculated on the basis of the pages of the description, claims, any drawings and one page for the abstract, in the language of filing. Where formal deficiencies in the documents making up the European patent application need to be corrected, the number of pages complying with the physical requirements (see A\u2011III,\u00a03 and A\u2011IX) is taken as the basis for calculation. In particular, deficiencies relating to minimum margins, each document making up the application starting on a new sheet, line spacing and character size as well as the scale of drawings can potentially impact the number of pages (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25\u00a0November\u00a02022, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02022, A113). Where this is the case, any additional fee due for the higher number of pages may be paid within two months of the invitation under Rule\u00a058 drawing the applicant's attention to this requirement.\nThe pages of the request for grant (EPO Form\u00a01001) and those forming part of a sequence listing within the meaning of Rule\u00a030(1) are not counted, provided the sequence listing contained in the description is filed in XML format, in compliance with WIPO Standard\u00a0ST.26 (see OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02021,\u00a0A97). By way of exception, an additional fee is not due either for a parent application's ST.25 sequence listing filed in PDF format as part of a divisional application (see OJ\u00a0EPO 2023, A98, and A\u2011IV,\u00a05.4). If the application is filed by reference to a previously filed application, the pages of the certified copy, excluding those for the certification, and for bibliographic data and any sequence listing in ST.25 if it is contained in the certified copy under Rule\u00a040(3), are taken as the basis for the calculation, excluding the pages for the certification, for bibliographic data and any sequence listing in ST.25 format contained in the certified copy under Rule\u00a040(3). If the application is filed without claims, the additional fee takes account of the pages of the first set of claims filed.\nWhere missing parts are filed under Rule\u00a056 (see\u00a0A\u2011II,\u00a05) or correct application documents are filed under Rule\u00a056a (see\u00a0A\u2011II,\u00a06), the additional fee is calculated on the basis of the documents present at expiry of the time limit under Rule\u00a038(3).\nEuro-PCT applications\nFor international (Euro-PCT) applications entering the European phase on or after 1\u00a0April\u00a02009, the additional fee is payable as part of the filing fee within the 31-month period of Rule\u00a0159(1). It In general, is calculated on the basis of the international application as published, regardless of the language of publication. The pages of the description, claims and drawings are counted, as well as one page for the bibliographic data with abstract. Any amendments under Art.\u00a019 PCT and/or Art.\u00a034 PCT are also considered part of the international publication and are taken into account for calculating the additional fee unless the applicant indicates that the procedure in the European phase is not to be based on them. The indications made in EPO Form\u00a01200 should be clear so the EPO can readily identify the pages for which the additional fee is payable. (even if published in a non\u2011EPO language), any amended claims under Art.\u00a019\u00a0PCT, which replace the claims as originally filed unless otherwise specified (see OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02017, A74), and one page for the abstract. If there is more than one page of bibliographic data, the further pages are not counted. The pages of the latest set of any amended documents (Art.\u00a034\u00a0PCT, amendments filed upon entry) on which European phase processing is to be based (Rule\u00a0159(1)(b)) will also be taken into account where available to the EPO by the date of payment of the additional fee within the 31 months. Any amended pages are added to the calculation of the page fee unless the applicant clearly specifies, at the latest by the date of payment, the amended pages which are to replace the corresponding pages of the application as published (see also E\u2011IX,\u00a02.1.1). This information should preferably be given in the relevant section of the form for entry into the European phase, and in particular in the related table (see notes on EPO Form\u00a01200). If the applicant explicitly states that application documents filed on entry into the European phase have merely been reformatted (to reduce the number of pages subject to payment of an additional fee) rather than substantively amended, the EPO disregards these reformatted application documents and does not accept them as the basis for calculation of the additional fee (see the notice from the EPO dated 26\u00a0January 2009, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009, 118, and its supplement, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009, 338).\nThe pages of EPO Form 1200 itself and those forming part of a standard-compliant sequence listing under Rule\u00a030(1) are not counted.\nAmended application\nIf amendments are filed on entry into the European phase, the basis for calculating the additional fee depends on the language in which the international application was published, i.e. one of the EPO's official languages or another language, e.g. Chinese.\n(i)International publication is in an EPO language\nThe additional fee is based on the application as published, whereby any amended pages replace the respective pages of the application as published.\nIf the claims have been amended, the applicant must submit the entire set, even if the amendment concerns only some of them. The additional fee is then based on the entire set of claims as amended.\n(ii)International publication is not in an EPO language\nIf no amendments are filed on entry into the European phase, the application as published in a non\u2011EPO language (e.g. Chinese) is taken as the basis for calculating the additional fee. However, if pages are amended, the translation of the application as required under Art.\u00a0153(4) and Rule\u00a0159(1)(a) is taken as the basis instead. This is because the replacement pages are in a different language to the published pages, which would make a proper calculation of the additional fee impossible. Therefore, if the description or drawings are amended, the translation of the description or drawings is taken as the basis for calculating the additional fee. In this case, the amended pages replace the respective pages of the description or drawings as translated.\nIf only the claims are amended, the additional fee is based on the description and drawings as published in Chinese plus the entire set of claims as amended in the EPO language. If the claims are not amended, the additional fee is based on the claims as published in Chinese.\nAny replacement pages must be filed in an official EPO language. Where the international application has not been published in an official EPO language, the additional fee for any amended description or drawings will be based on the translation of the international application filed on entry into the European phase (see\u00a0E\u2011IX,\u00a02.1.4). Where claims are replaced, they must be submitted as an entire new set. The additional fee is then calculated on the basis of the amended set in the EPO language (OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009, 338).If the applicant explicitly states that application documents filed on entry into the European phase have merely been reformatted (to reduce the number of pages subject to payment of an additional fee) rather than substantively amended, the EPO disregards these reformatted application documents and does not accept them as the basis for calculation of the additional fee (see the notice from the EPO dated 26\u00a0January 2009, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009, 118, and its supplement, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009, 338).\nEPO\u00a0Form\u00a01200 is disregarded in the calculation of the additional fee.\nThe pages of any WIPO Standard\u00a0ST.25-compliant sequence listing in TXT format filed as part of the description are disregarded when calculating the additional fee for Euro-PCT applications with an international filing date prior to 1\u00a0July 2022. If the international filing date is on or after 1\u00a0July 2022, the pages of a WIPO Standard\u00a0ST.26-compliant sequence listing in XML format are disregarded.\nIn application of the general principles described above, for international applications comprising both erroneously filed application documents and correct application documents incorporated by reference (Rule\u00a020.6 PCT in conjunction with Rule\u00a020.5bis(d) PCT), irrespective of their date of filing (see OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02020, A81, and OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02022, A71; see also C\u2011III,\u00a01.3), the additional fee must be paid for all application documents contained in the international publication unless any are replaced by amendments filed on entry into the European phase, as specified by the applicant.\nFor international applications with an international filing date on or before 31\u00a0October\u00a02022, corrections that the receiving Office allowed to be incorporated under Rule\u00a020.6 PCT in conjunction with Rule\u00a020.5bis(d) PCT are not effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated or elected Office (see\u00a0OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02020, A81). Nevertheless, the above general principles for calculating the additional fee apply. However, where applicants choose the abridged procedure outlined in C\u2011III,\u00a01.3 and the declaration to renounce the correct application documents incorporated by reference under Rule\u00a020.5bis(d)\u00a0PCT is received within the 31-month period for entering the European phase and before payment of the additional fee, this renunciation is, for the calculation of the additional fee, equal to an amendment of the international application as published. Accordingly, those pages identified in the publication of the international application as \"Incorporated by reference (Rule\u00a020.6)\" are deducted from the international application as published. The same principle applies if, within the 31-month period for entering the European phase, the applicants declare their intention to renounce the erroneously filed application documents and, thus, the initial filing date. In that case, the erroneously filed pages are deducted from the international application as published when calculating the additional fee.\nWhere the international application was published in a non\u2011EPO language, the general practice described above also applies. Since the applicant's intention to follow the abridged procedure on entry into the European phase is considered an amendment of the international application as published, the additional fee is calculated on the basis of the translation of those application documents that are maintained for the further proceedings (either the correct application documents incorporated by reference or the erroneously filed ones) and any further amendments replacing (part of) them (see the notice from the EPO dated 14\u00a0June\u00a02020, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02020,\u00a0A81).\nExample 1:\nInternational application, published in English, containing 100\u00a0pages:\nAbstract\n\n1\u00a0\n\n\nDescription\n\n50\u00a0\n\n\nClaims\n\n20\u00a0\n\n\nDrawings\n\n20\u00a0\n\n\nclaims, Art.\u00a019\u00a0PCT\n\n9\u00a0\n\n\nTotal pages\n\n100\n\n\nAmended claims (EP entry)\n\n10\u00a0\n\n\nOn entry into European phase, within the 31-month period, 10\u00a0pages of amended claims are filed to replace previous pages of claims, as indicated by the applicant in EPO Form\u00a01200.\n\u2192 number of pages on which calculation is based:\u00a0100 - 20 (original claims) - 9 (Art.\u00a019 PCT) + 10 (amended claims on EP\u00a0entry) - 35 (fee-exempt)\n\u2192 number of pages to be paid for: 46\nExample 2:\nInternational application, published in Chinese, containing 75 pages:\n\n\nNumber of pages in Chinese (ZH)\n\nNumber of pages in English (EN), translation filed on entry into the European phase\n\n\nAbstract\n\n1\u00a0\n\n1\u00a0\n\nDescription\n\n40\u00a0\n\n50\u00a0\n\nClaims\n\n15\u00a0\n\n25\u00a0\n\nDrawings\n\n19\u00a0\n\n19\u00a0\n\nTotal number of pages\n\n75\n\n95\n\nAmended description of the translation\n\n-\u00a0\n\n3\u00a0\n\nOn entry into the European phase, the translation into English is filed within the 31-month period.

The fee amount depends on the number of pages over 35. The language reduction under Rule\u00a06(3) applies if the requirements of Rule\u00a06(4),\u00a0Rule\u00a06(6)\u00a0and\u00a0Rule\u00a06(7) have been met (see\u00a0A\u2011X,\u00a09.2.1 and A\u2011X,\u00a09.2.2). The additional fee is payable within one month of the application's filing date or of the date of receipt of a European divisional application or a European patent application according to Art.\u00a061(1)(b). If the application is filed without claims or by reference to a previously filed application, the additional fee is payable within one month of filing the first set of claims or the certified copy of the application referred to in Rule\u00a040(3), whichever expires later. The additional fee is calculated on the basis of the pages of the description, claims, any drawings and one page for the abstract, in the language of filing. Where formal deficiencies in the documents making up the European patent application need to be corrected, the number of pages complying with the physical requirements (see A\u2011III,\u00a03 and A\u2011IX) is taken as the basis for calculation. In particular, deficiencies relating to minimum margins, each document making up the application starting on a new sheet, line spacing and character size as well as the scale of drawings can potentially impact the number of pages (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25\u00a0November\u00a02022, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02022, A113). Where this is the case, any additional fee due for the higher number of pages may be paid within two months of the invitation under Rule\u00a058 drawing the applicant's attention to this requirement.\nThe pages of the request for grant (EPO Form\u00a01001) and those forming part of a sequence listing within the meaning of Rule\u00a030(1) are not counted, provided the sequence listing contained in the description is filed in XML format, in compliance with WIPO Standard\u00a0ST.26 (see OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02021,\u00a0A97). By way of exception, an additional fee is not due either for a parent application's ST.25 sequence listing filed in PDF format as part of a divisional application (see OJ\u00a0EPO 2023, A98, and A\u2011IV,\u00a05.4). If the application is filed by reference to a previously filed application, the pages of the certified copy, excluding those for the certification, and for bibliographic data and any sequence listing in ST.25 if it is contained in the certified copy under Rule\u00a040(3), are taken as the basis for the calculation, excluding the pages for the certification, for bibliographic data and any sequence listing in ST.25 format contained in the certified copy under Rule\u00a040(3). If the application is filed without claims, the additional fee takes account of the pages of the first set of claims filed.\nWhere missing parts are filed under Rule\u00a056 (see\u00a0A\u2011II,\u00a05) or correct application documents are filed under Rule\u00a056a (see\u00a0A\u2011II,\u00a06), the additional fee is calculated on the basis of the documents present at expiry of the time limit under Rule\u00a038(3).\nEuro-PCT applications\nFor international (Euro-PCT) applications entering the European phase on or after 1\u00a0April\u00a02009, the additional fee is payable as part of the filing fee within the 31-month period of Rule\u00a0159(1). It In general, is calculated on the basis of the international application as published, regardless of the language of publication. The pages of the description, claims and drawings are counted, as well as one page for the bibliographic data with abstract. Any amendments under Art.\u00a019 PCT and/or Art.\u00a034 PCT are also considered part of the international publication and are taken into account for calculating the additional fee unless the applicant indicates that the procedure in the European phase is not to be based on them. The indications made in EPO Form\u00a01200 should be clear so the EPO can readily identify the pages for which the additional fee is payable. (even if published in a non\u2011EPO language), any amended claims under Art.\u00a019\u00a0PCT, which replace the claims as originally filed unless otherwise specified (see OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02017, A74), and one page for the abstract. If there is more than one page of bibliographic data, the further pages are not counted. The pages of the latest set of any amended documents (Art.\u00a034\u00a0PCT, amendments filed upon entry) on which European phase processing is to be based (Rule\u00a0159(1)(b)) will also be taken into account where available to the EPO by the date of payment of the additional fee within the 31 months. Any amended pages are added to the calculation of the page fee unless the applicant clearly specifies, at the latest by the date of payment, the amended pages which are to replace the corresponding pages of the application as published (see also E\u2011IX,\u00a02.1.1). This information should preferably be given in the relevant section of the form for entry into the European phase, and in particular in the related table (see notes on EPO Form\u00a01200). If the applicant explicitly states that application documents filed on entry into the European phase have merely been reformatted (to reduce the number of pages subject to payment of an additional fee) rather than substantively amended, the EPO disregards these reformatted application documents and does not accept them as the basis for calculation of the additional fee (see the notice from the EPO dated 26\u00a0January 2009, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009, 118, and its supplement, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009, 338).\nThe pages of EPO Form 1200 itself and those forming part of a standard-compliant sequence listing under Rule\u00a030(1) are not counted.\nAmended application\nIf amendments are filed on entry into the European phase, the basis for calculating the additional fee depends on the language in which the international application was published, i.e. one of the EPO's official languages or another language, e.g. Chinese.\n(i)International publication is in an EPO language\nThe additional fee is based on the application as published, whereby any amended pages replace the respective pages of the application as published.\nIf the claims have been amended, the applicant must submit the entire set, even if the amendment concerns only some of them. The additional fee is then based on the entire set of claims as amended.\n(ii)International publication is not in an EPO language\nIf no amendments are filed on entry into the European phase, the application as published in a non\u2011EPO language (e.g. Chinese) is taken as the basis for calculating the additional fee. However, if pages are amended, the translation of the application as required under Art.\u00a0153(4) and Rule\u00a0159(1)(a) is taken as the basis instead. This is because the replacement pages are in a different language to the published pages, which would make a proper calculation of the additional fee impossible. Therefore, if the description or drawings are amended, the translation of the description or drawings is taken as the basis for calculating the additional fee. In this case, the amended pages replace the respective pages of the description or drawings as translated.\nIf only the claims are amended, the additional fee is based on the description and drawings as published in Chinese plus the entire set of claims as amended in the EPO language. If the claims are not amended, the additional fee is based on the claims as published in Chinese.\nAny replacement pages must be filed in an official EPO language. Where the international application has not been published in an official EPO language, the additional fee for any amended description or drawings will be based on the translation of the international application filed on entry into the European phase (see\u00a0E\u2011IX,\u00a02.1.4). Where claims are replaced, they must be submitted as an entire new set. The additional fee is then calculated on the basis of the amended set in the EPO language (OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009, 338).If the applicant explicitly states that application documents filed on entry into the European phase have merely been reformatted (to reduce the number of pages subject to payment of an additional fee) rather than substantively amended, the EPO disregards these reformatted application documents and does not accept them as the basis for calculation of the additional fee (see the notice from the EPO dated 26\u00a0January 2009, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009, 118, and its supplement, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009, 338).\nEPO\u00a0Form\u00a01200 is disregarded in the calculation of the additional fee.\nThe pages of any WIPO Standard\u00a0ST.25-compliant sequence listing in TXT format filed as part of the description are disregarded when calculating the additional fee for Euro-PCT applications with an international filing date prior to 1\u00a0July 2022. If the international filing date is on or after 1\u00a0July 2022, the pages of a WIPO Standard\u00a0ST.26-compliant sequence listing in XML format are disregarded.\nIn application of the general principles described above, for international applications comprising both erroneously filed application documents and correct application documents incorporated by reference (Rule\u00a020.6 PCT in conjunction with Rule\u00a020.5bis(d) PCT), irrespective of their date of filing (see OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02020, A81, and OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02022, A71; see also C\u2011III,\u00a01.3), the additional fee must be paid for all application documents contained in the international publication unless any are replaced by amendments filed on entry into the European phase, as specified by the applicant.\nFor international applications with an international filing date on or before 31\u00a0October\u00a02022, corrections that the receiving Office allowed to be incorporated under Rule\u00a020.6 PCT in conjunction with Rule\u00a020.5bis(d) PCT are not effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated or elected Office (see\u00a0OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02020, A81). Nevertheless, the above general principles for calculating the additional fee apply. However, where applicants choose the abridged procedure outlined in C\u2011III,\u00a01.3 and the declaration to renounce the correct application documents incorporated by reference under Rule\u00a020.5bis(d)\u00a0PCT is received within the 31-month period for entering the European phase and before payment of the additional fee, this renunciation is, for the calculation of the additional fee, equal to an amendment of the international application as published. Accordingly, those pages identified in the publication of the international application as \"Incorporated by reference (Rule\u00a020.6)\" are deducted from the international application as published. The same principle applies if, within the 31-month period for entering the European phase, the applicants declare their intention to renounce the erroneously filed application documents and, thus, the initial filing date. In that case, the erroneously filed pages are deducted from the international application as published when calculating the additional fee.\nWhere the international application was published in a non\u2011EPO language, the general practice described above also applies. Since the applicant's intention to follow the abridged procedure on entry into the European phase is considered an amendment of the international application as published, the additional fee is calculated on the basis of the translation of those application documents that are maintained for the further proceedings (either the correct application documents incorporated by reference or the erroneously filed ones) and any further amendments replacing (part of) them (see the notice from the EPO dated 14\u00a0June\u00a02020, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02020,\u00a0A81).\nExample 1:\nInternational application, published in English, containing 100\u00a0pages:\nAbstract\n\n1\u00a0\n\n\nDescription\n\n50\u00a0\n\n\nClaims\n\n20\u00a0\n\n\nDrawings\n\n20\u00a0\n\n\nclaims, Art.\u00a019\u00a0PCT\n\n9\u00a0\n\n\nTotal pages\n\n100\n\n\nAmended claims (EP entry)\n\n10\u00a0\n\n\nOn entry into European phase, within the 31-month period, 10\u00a0pages of amended claims are filed to replace previous pages of claims, as indicated by the applicant in EPO Form\u00a01200.\n\u2192 number of pages on which calculation is based:\u00a0100 - 20 (original claims) - 9 (Art.\u00a019 PCT) + 10 (amended claims on EP\u00a0entry) - 35 (fee-exempt)\n\u2192 number of pages to be paid for: 46\nExample 2:\nInternational application, published in Chinese, containing 75 pages:\n\n\nNumber of pages in Chinese (ZH)\n\nNumber of pages in English (EN), translation filed on entry into the European phase\n\n\nAbstract\n\n1\u00a0\n\n1\u00a0\n\nDescription\n\n40\u00a0\n\n50\u00a0\n\nClaims\n\n15\u00a0\n\n25\u00a0\n\nDrawings\n\n19\u00a0\n\n19\u00a0\n\nTotal number of pages\n\n75\n\n95\n\nAmended description of the translation\n\n-\u00a0\n\n3\u00a0\n\nOn entry into the European phase, the translation into English is filed within the 31-month period.

The EPO makes a copy of these documents and places them in the divisional application's file (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12\u00a0July\u00a02007, Special edition No.\u00a03, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02007, B.2).\nIf, when the divisional application is filed, a priority document has not been filed in respect of the parent application, it must be filed in respect of the divisional application and, if the priority claim of the parent application's remaining subject-matter is to be retained, in respect of the parent application also.

Also, in accordance with Rule\u00a014(4), the period for payment of renewal fee with an additional fee provided for in Rule\u00a051(2) is not interrupted.\nExample: The European Patent Bulletin mentions the European search report's publication on 15\u00a0March\u00a02017.

At the resumption of proceedings, the six-month period from the date of the mention of the search report's publication for payment of the examination fee (Rule\u00a070(1)) does not begin to run again in its entirety but only for the days and months not yet elapsed. This time must not be less than two months (Rule\u00a014(4)).\nThe six-month period starts on the day following the search report's publication, in accordance with Rule\u00a0131(2), i.e.\u00a0on 16\u00a0March\u00a02017, and ends on 15\u00a0September\u00a02017.

The remaining period to run after the resumption is more than two months.\nCalculation of the remaining non-elapsed period:\nOn the day of suspension, 5\u00a0May\u00a02017, the first month of the running period has passed and so have 19\u00a0days of the second month. Thus, on that day, 11\u00a0days and four months remain (from 5\u00a0May\u00a02017 to 15\u00a0May\u00a02017 inclusive and from 15\u00a0May\u00a02017 to 15\u00a0September\u00a02017 inclusive). This non-elapsed period must be added to the date of resumption in order to calculate the deadline for payment of the examination fee.\nResumption is on 18\u00a0August\u00a02017. All time limits start running again from and including this day (Rule\u00a0131(2) does not apply):\nAfter adding first the remaining days and then the remaining months, it is necessary to check whether the last day falls on a day on which the EPO receives mail according to Rule\u00a0134(1): calculating 11\u00a0days from and including 18\u00a0August\u00a02017 results in 28\u00a0August\u00a02017. Adding four months to that gives 28\u00a0December\u00a02017 as the end of the time limit for payment of the fee.

These preparations are considered completed at the end of the day that comes five weeks before expiry of the 18th month following the earliest date of priority if priority is claimed, or following the filing date if the priority is abandoned or no priority is claimed (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12\u00a0July\u00a02007, Special edition No.\u00a03, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02007, D.1). The applicant is informed about the termination of the preparations, the publication number and intended publication date. Where the priority abandonment notification is received after that time, publication, if not already completed, takes place as if the priority date applied, although a notice as to the abandonment of the priority will appear in the European Patent Bulletin (see\u00a0F\u2011VI,\u00a03.5).

Both individual and general authorisations (see A\u2011VIII,\u00a01.7) within the meaning of Rule\u00a0152(4) serve the same purpose. For general authorisations, the indication of the registration number is equivalent to the filing of the authorisation itself. The filing of an authorisation is distinct from the appointment of a representative for a specific case. If the requirements of Art.\u00a0133(2) are not fulfilled, the same period will be specified for the communication of the appointment and, where applicable, for the filing of the authorisation.\nProfessional representatives who identify themselves as such will be required to file a signed authorisation only in certain cases, in particular if there is a change of representative (see Art.\u00a01(2) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12\u00a0July\u00a02007, Special edition No.\u00a03, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02007,\u00a0L.1). No authorisation is required where a professional representative other than the appointed one (and not being a member of the same association or law firm) performs a procedural act on behalf of a party to proceedings, e.g.\u00a0filing a reply to the communication under Rule\u00a071(3), provided that it is apparent from the submission that they are acting at the request of that party without the intention to take over representation. In case of doubt as to a professional representative's entitlement to act on behalf of a party, the EPO may require the filing of an authorisation (see Art.\u00a01(3) of the above decision).\nHowever, a legal practitioner entitled to act as a professional representative in accordance with Art.\u00a0134(8) or an employee acting for an applicant in accordance with Art.\u00a0133(3), first sentence, but who is not a professional representative, must always file a signed authorisation (see\u00a0Art.\u00a02 and Art.\u00a03 of the above decision) to be in a position to validly perform procedural acts. In Euro-PCT proceedings, persons representing clients applicants in these capacities are not required to file signed authorisations if they have already filed an authorisation expressly covering proceedings established by the EPC with the EPO as receiving Office, ISA or IPEA. Where a representative is appointed to act on behalf of the applicant in several of that party's applications, it is not necessary to file an individual authorisation for each application (see A\u2011VIII,\u00a02.4). A clear indication of the applications concerned is sufficient; the EPO will make sure that a copy of the authorisation is included in all of the files concerned.\nThe authorisation can also be filed by the applicant. This also applies where the applicant is obliged to be represented, as fulfilling the requirement to be represented is not itself a procedural step under Art.\u00a0133(2) to which the rule of obligatory representation applies.\nAn association of representatives can be authorised to represent a party before the EPO within the meaning of Art.\u00a0134(1) (Rule\u00a0152(11)). A party appointing several representatives can authorise them collectively as an association instead of having to do so individually, provided that the association in question is registered with the EPO (OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02013,\u00a0535). Where invited to file an authorisation by way of an exception, a reference to that registration number in the authorisation will suffice.\nAn authorisation remains in force until its termination is communicated to the EPO. Transfer of representation or termination of authorisation can, subject to certain conditions, be effected electronically by the representative using the My\u00a0Files service (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 26\u00a0April\u00a02012, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02012,\u00a0352).

As regards the authorisation, see\u00a0A\u2011VIII,\u00a01.6. The signature of the entitled person confirming performance of a written act of procedure helps to clarify the state of the proceedings. It shows whether the act of procedure has been validly performed and also prevents circumvention of the provisions relating to representation. EPO\u00a0Form\u00a01038 (letter accompanying subsequently filed items) may also be used as a separate letter. A separate form must be used for each file (see the notice from the EPO dated 8\u00a0November\u00a01990, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a01991,\u00a064). The same applies when, instead of using EPO\u00a0Form\u00a01038, the applicant submits an accompanying letter with the document in question (see also A\u2011VIII,\u00a02.4). In the case of electronic filing, several documents for a file can be attached to a single EPO\u00a0Form\u00a01038E.\nEPO\u00a0Form\u00a01037 can be used for the subsequent filing on paper, at the same time, of items relating to several applications, but without signature. EPO\u00a0Form\u00a01037 is merely an acknowledgment. Its use is particularly recommended for subsequent filing of documents already bearing the required signature (such as replies to communications).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part A \u2013 Guidelines for Formalities Examination", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Common provisions", "title": "3.2 Documents forming part of the European patent application\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part A \u2013 Guidelines for Formalities Examination", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Common provisions", "title": "3.3 Form of signature\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part A \u2013 Guidelines for Formalities Examination", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Common provisions", "title": "3.4 Joint applicants\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Rule\u00a0151": "If there is more than one applicant (see\u00a0A\u2011VIII,\u00a01.3), each applicant or their appointed representative must sign the request for grant and, where applicable, the appointment of the common representative.

This deferred due date, and hence the expiry of another period (the 31-month period), forms the basis for calculating the additional period for payment of the renewal fee with an additional fee (see J\u00a01/89, the principles of which apply).

If the renewal fee is not paid on the date early processing is requested, the request for early processing will be effective only from the date on which the renewal fee is paid (and all further requirements necessary on the latter date have been complied with) (see\u00a0E\u2011IX,\u00a02.8).\n", "Article\u00a086": "The obligation to pay renewal fees terminates with the payment of the renewal fee due in respect of the (patent) year in which the mention of the grant of the European patent is published, see Art.\u00a086(2). \"Patent years\" are calculated as from the application's filing date.

In addition, for a time limit for payment to be deemed observed, the full amount of the fee must have been paid in due time.\nAn essential condition for a valid payment to the EPO in the case of payment or transfer to the bank account held by the European Patent Organisation is that the amount enters that account. The payment is valid in respect of the amount entering the account. If an insufficient amount has been paid by mistake, it is not possible to rectify the error by having the shortfall paid subsequently deemed paid on the original date of payment. The same applies to payments made via credit card. Payment is a matter of fact whereby a certain amount is transferred to and put at the disposal of the EPO. It is not, therefore, a document filed with the EPO or a procedural declaration that may be corrected under Rule\u00a0139. However, the EPO may, where it is considered justified, overlook any small amounts lacking without prejudice to the rights of the person making the payment (Art.\u00a08\u00a0RFees).\nIn the case of payment via deposit account, the essential condition, in addition to those specified under points (i)-(ii) above, is that the debit order clearly specifies the purpose of payment by indicating the fee intended to be paid, thus authorising the EPO to debit the fee for this particular purpose. Furthermore, the EPO can only debit the full amount of the fee if there are sufficient funds in the deposit account. In respect of underpayments due to incorrect information given in a debit order, see A\u2011X,\u00a04.2.3.

Indication of the purpose of the payment serves to identify the proceedings for which the fee is intended (e.g.\u00a0for fee payments, the application number) and the specific type of fee. If the purpose of the payment cannot immediately be established, the person making the payment will be requested to communicate the purpose in writing within a specified period. If they comply with this request in due time, the payment and the original payment date remain valid. This is also the case when the clarification involves reassigning the payment to another application. Otherwise the payment will be considered not made. The boards of appeal have decided that if the purpose of the payment has evidently been given incorrectly, this deficiency is not prejudicial if the intended purpose can be established without difficulty from the remaining information. The inadvertent use of a fee by the EPO for a different purpose from that evidently intended by the person making the payment has no effect on the purpose intended by that person (see\u00a0J\u00a016/84).

The content of priority documents corresponds to the application documents as available on the filing date and as contained in the electronic file, reproduced in black and white (see\u00a0A\u2011IX,\u00a01.2 and 7.1 and the notice from the EPO dated 14\u00a0January 2020, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02020, A7).\nWhere a European patent application claims the priority of a previous European patent application or an international application filed with the EPO as receiving Office under the PCT, a certified copy of the previous application will be included in the file free of charge. Furthermore, if the patent office at which a European priority document is to be filed participates in the WIPO Digital Access Service (DAS), it is possible for that office to retrieve the European priority document free of charge via DAS by providing the access code that the EPO generates for every European patent application filed with it and every international application filed with the EPO as receiving Office (see\u00a0also\u00a0A\u2011III,\u00a06.7).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part B \u2013 Guidelines for Search", "chapter": "Chapter I \u2013 Introduction", "title": "Chapter I \u2013 Introduction", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part B \u2013 Guidelines for Search", "chapter": "Chapter I \u2013 Introduction", "title": "1.

No meaningful search possible\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Rule\u00a063": "In addition to the reasons discussed in B\u2011VIII,\u00a01, an invitation under Rule\u00a063(1) may be issued and the search subsequently limited under Rule\u00a063(2) because the application falls so short of the relevant EPC requirements that it is impossible to carry out a meaningful search on all or some of the claims or part of a claim. The search division then applies the procedure under Rule\u00a063 (see\u00a0B\u2011VIII,\u00a03.1\u00a0to\u00a0B-VIII,\u00a03.4 and OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02009,\u00a0533).\nRule\u00a063 relates only to whether the search is practicable and not to whether its results are likely to be relevant in the later examination proceedings. Even if a search will not produce any result that could be used in examination proceedings, it cannot be refused on the basis of Rule\u00a063 (see\u00a0T\u00a01242/04).\nWhat is or is not \"meaningful\" is a question of fact to be answered by the search division. Its finding may change in the light of any reply from the applicant to the invitation under Rule\u00a063(1) (see\u00a0B\u2011VIII,\u00a03.2). How the search division exercises its discretion will depend on the facts of the case. A restriction of the search must be carefully considered. There are cases where a search is impossible in practice in view of the failure to meet the EPC requirements, for example a fundamental lack of clarity or the absence of any technical character whatsoever. However, the word \"meaningful\" must always be construed reasonably, i.e.\u00a0Rule\u00a063 cannot be invoked simply because a search is difficult or does not produce results relevant for subsequent examination proceedings.\nAs there is no legal provision requiring that applicants draft their application in a way that makes searching easier, \"procedural economy\" cannot be used as a reason, or part of a reason, for issuing a partial search report (see also T\u00a01020/98).\nThe following \u2013 non-exhaustive \u2013 examples illustrate where Rule\u00a063 can apply:\n(i)claims lacking support; insufficient disclosure\u00a0\nAn example is a claim so broadly formulated that its scope is at least to some extent speculative, i.e. not supported by the disclosure of the application. It is then so broad that a meaningful search cannot be carried out over its whole scope but only on the basis of the narrower, disclosed invention. In extreme cases, this may mean a search covering only (one or more of) the specific examples disclosed in the description. The procedure under Rule\u00a063(1) can then be applied (see\u00a0B\u2011VIII,\u00a03.1\u00a0to\u00a0B\u2011VIII,\u00a03.4) on the basis of a failure to meet the requirements of sufficiency of disclosure and support set out in Art.\u00a083 and Art.\u00a084 (see\u00a0F\u2011III,\u00a01 and F-III,\u00a02, and F\u2011IV,\u00a06). However, the search division needs to bear in mind that whether these requirements are met has to be assessed from the point of view of the person skilled in the art.\n(ii)claims lacking conciseness\u00a0\nAn example is where there are so many claims, or so many possibilities within a claim, that it is unduly burdensome to determine the subject-matter for which protection is sought (however, see\u00a0B\u2011VIII,\u00a04 on multiple independent claims in the same category). A complete search (or even any search at all) may then be impossible in practice. Again, it may be appropriate to apply Rule\u00a063 and then issue a partial search report (following the procedures described in B\u2011VIII,\u00a03.1 to B-VIII,\u00a03.3) or a declaration of no search, on the grounds that the claims are so lacking in conciseness that a meaningful search is impossible (see\u00a0Art.\u00a084; F\u2011IV,\u00a05).\n(iii)claims lacking clarity\u00a0\nAn example is where the parameter chosen by the applicant to define the invention makes a meaningful comparison with the prior art impossible, for example because the prior art did not use the same parameter or did not use any parameter at all. The applicant's parameter may then lack clarity (see\u00a0Art.\u00a084; F\u2011IV,\u00a04.11) and it may even be so unclear that a meaningful search of the claims, an individual claim or part of an individual claim is impossible. It may then be appropriate to apply Rule\u00a063 and issue a partial search report (or, in exceptional cases, no search report at all) under Rule\u00a063(2) (following the procedures described in B\u2011VIII,\u00a03.1 to B-VIII,\u00a03.3) after restricting the search to the worked examples, in so far as they can be understood, or to the way in which the desired parameter is obtained (any reply from the applicant to the invitation under Rule\u00a063(1) would then be taken into account as described in B\u2011VIII,\u00a03.2 to determine the subject-matter to be searched).\n(iv)claims contravening Art.\u00a076 or Art.\u00a0123(2)\nRule\u00a063 may also apply in the following cases of claims containing added subject-matter (see\u00a0B\u2011VIII,\u00a06):\n\u2013\u00a0claims in divisional applications contravening Art.\u00a076\n\u2013\u00a0applications for which the claims were filed after the filing date and which contravene Art.\u00a0123(2) or\n\u2013\u00a0Euro-PCT applications for which amended claims were filed as a basis for the supplementary European search and which contravene Art.\u00a0123(2).\nThese examples are not exhaustive (see also B\u2011VIII,\u00a06). The basic principle is that it needs to be clear and transparent for both the applicant and third parties what has and has not been searched.\nHow these Rule\u00a063 cases are handled in subsequent examination proceedings is dealt with in H\u2011II,\u00a05\u00a0and\u00a0H\u2011IV,\u00a04.1.1.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part B \u2013 Guidelines for Search", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Subject-matter to be excluded from the search", "title": "3.1 Invitation to indicate subject-matter for search\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Rule\u00a063": "If the search division considers that the application falls so short of the EPC requirements that it cannot carry out a meaningful search into the state of the art on the basis of all or some of the subject-matter claimed (see\u00a0B\u2011VIII,\u00a01,\u00a0B-VIII,\u00a02 and B-VIII,\u00a03), it will invite the applicant to file, within two months, a statement indicating the subject-matter to be searched. The invitation will also give the reasons for this finding and may additionally indicate the claimed subject-matter on which the search division considers it feasible to base a meaningful search.\nIn the particular case of medical method claims, the search division issues a complete search report only when the claims can easily be reworded to comprise patentable subject-matter (see\u00a0B\u2011VIII,\u00a02.1). If, on the other hand, it plans to issue a partial search report (or a declaration of no search), it must first send an invitation (e.g.\u00a0for the claims that cannot easily be reworded).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part B \u2013 Guidelines for Search", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Subject-matter to be excluded from the search", "title": "3.2 Reply to the invitation under  - Rule\u00a063(1) -  ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part B \u2013 Guidelines for Search", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Subject-matter to be excluded from the search", "title": "3.2.1 No or late reply\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part B \u2013 Guidelines for Search", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Subject-matter to be excluded from the search", "title": "3.2.2 Reply in time\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Rule\u00a063": "If applicants reply to the invitation under Rule\u00a063(1) in time and the search division considers it possible to carry out a meaningful search based on the subject-matter they have indicated, it will search that subject-matter.\nIf applicants reply to the invitation under Rule\u00a063(1) in time but the indicated subject-matter still cannot be fully searched, the search division will take its own decision on what to search, but will keep to what was indicated in the applicant's reply as far as possible. In exceptional cases, it may find that no meaningful search is possible at all.\nStatements consisting of reworded claims filed in reply to an invitation under Rule\u00a063(1) are not considered amended claims within the meaning of Rule\u00a0137(1) but treated merely as explanations of the originally filed claims. The applicant must formally introduce these reworded claims into the proceedings by confirming that this is what they want within the time limit under Rule\u00a070(1) or\u00a0(2). The confirmation can be filed either together with the reply to the extended European search report (Rules\u00a070a(1) and Rule\u00a070a(2)) or, where applicable, when complying with the requirements under Rule\u00a070(1) or\u00a0(2). As far as possible, the search division will draw up the search report in the light of these explanations. Both the search report and the search opinion must clearly indicate what has been searched.\nInstead of indicating the subject-matter to be searched, applicants can reply to the invitation under Rule\u00a063(1) by simply arguing why they believe a meaningful search can be carried out on all of the subject-matter claimed. If the search division is convinced by the applicant's arguments, it will issue a full search report. The search will therefore not be limited and there will be none of the associated consequences in examination. But if it is not convinced, or is only partially convinced, it will take its own decision on what to search and then issue a partial search report or, in exceptional cases, a declaration of no search. The examining division has final responsibility for deciding whether it was appropriate to send an invitation under Rule\u00a063 and issue a declaration of no search or a partial search report at the search stage and it may find that it has to carry out an additional search (see\u00a0C\u2011IV,\u00a07.3).\nApplicants can also reply to an invitation under Rule\u00a063 by arguing against the findings there and \u2012 as a main request \u2012 asking the search division to fully search the claims as filed and \u2012 as an alternative, in case the search division is still not convinced \u2012 indicating specific subject-matter they would like to have searched (see also H\u2011III,\u00a03.2).\nA consultation may take place if the applicant phones the search division to enquire about the course of action after an invitation under Rule\u00a063 has been sent. The consultation is limited to formal issues concerning the content of the invitation and the options available to the applicant. The search division writes minutes of the consultation and sends them to the applicant (without setting any time limit) for information only. The consultation itself does not count as a valid reply to the invitation and so the applicant still has to file a written reply within the time limit set there.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part B \u2013 Guidelines for Search", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Subject-matter to be excluded from the search", "title": "3.3 Content of the extended European search report (EESR)\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part B \u2013 Guidelines for Search", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Subject-matter to be excluded from the search", "title": "3.4 Applications falling under  - Rule\u00a063 -  and lacking unity ", "implementation": {"Rule\u00a0164": "Rule\u00a063 also applies to searches performed under Rule\u00a0164(2) (see\u00a0C\u2011III,\u00a03.1).

For any claimed invention or group of inventions within the meaning of Art.\u00a082 not searched by the EPO in its capacity as ISA or SISA, the examining division issues an invitation to pay search fees.\nThe application documents as amended may contain claims directed to a non-searched invention in situations other than where the application documents that are to serve as the basis for examination do not meet the requirement of unity of invention.\nFor instance, the amended application may contain just one invention, but it may be an invention that was claimed but not searched by the EPO as (S)ISA in the international phase. In this case, there is no non-unity objection for this set of claims and the reasoning in the invitation needs only to refer to the non-unity objection in the WO\u2011ISA and to the fact that no additional fee was paid for this invention during the international phase.\nIt may well be that an invention in the application documents was not even claimed in the application documents that served as the basis for the procedure in the international phase and has been imported from the description (see\u00a0F\u2011V,\u00a07.1(iv)). In such a case, an invitation to pay search fees under Rule\u00a0164(2) for any non-searched invention is to be issued by the examining division, irrespective of whether lack of unity persists in the claims. The invitation under Rule\u00a0164(2) must state that \u2013 and why \u2013 this is a new invention not searched in the international phase. If there are other inventions present in the claims that were also not searched (but were claimed in the PCT phase), the applicant must also be invited by way of the same invitation to pay further search fees in respect of those inventions. In assessing whether or not subject-matter present in amended claims constitutes a previously unclaimed invention imported from the description (for which an invitation under Rule\u00a0164(2) is to be sent), the principles laid down for assessing compliance with Rule\u00a0137(5) (see in H\u2011IV,\u00a04.1.2) are to be taken into account.\nThe application documents forming the basis for the European phase may also cover inventions or groups of inventions not searched in the (supplementary) international search report as a result of the procedure for erroneously filed elements under Rule\u00a020.5bis\u00a0PCT (see C\u2011III,\u00a01.3). In this case too, an invitation to pay search fees under Rule\u00a0164(2) is to be issued by the examining division.\nThe invitation under Rule\u00a0164(2) must be sent before any communication under Art.\u00a094(3). For Rule\u00a0164(2) to apply, the claims must be sufficiently clear to allow the identification of a non-searched invention triggering the procedure under Rule\u00a0164(2). If the claims are so unclear that a non-searched invention cannot be identified, the first action must be to issue a communication under Art.\u00a094(3) setting out the objections under Art.\u00a084. Should it turn out later in the procedure that amended claims are indeed directed to a non-searched invention, the applicant must file a divisional application for any such subject-matter. Recourse to Rule\u00a0164(2) is not provided for if, as a result of further amendments or clarification, (further) non-searched inventions are identified, since the procedure under Rule\u00a0164(2) applies to the application documents as submitted by the applicant as the basis for examination.\nIf auxiliary requests are submitted before a search under Rule\u00a0164(2) is performed, only the main request is taken into account for the purpose of the search (notwithstanding the exceptions relating to cases under Rule\u00a062a or Rule\u00a063 where main and auxiliary requests are both considered at the search stage, see B\u2011VIII,\u00a03.2.2\u00a0and\u00a0B\u2011VIII,\u00a04.2.2).\nIf any search fees are paid in due time, the results of the searches are communicated to the applicant as an annex to a communication under Art.\u00a094(3) and Rule\u00a071(1) and Rule\u00a071(2) or under Rule\u00a071(3), as set out in Rule\u00a0164(2)(b). This annex is entitled \"Search result according to Rule\u00a0164(2)\".\nIf the applicant pays the search fees in due time under Rule\u00a0164(2) and at the same time files a new set of claims, the search will be carried out and the written opinion issued for the claims on file upon expiry of the period under Rule\u00a0161 for which the invitation to pay was sent and the requested fees paid. The amended documents may, however, informally be taken into account by the examiner carrying out the search, where this appears appropriate. Applicants will have the opportunity to file amendments of their own volition after receiving the results of the search under Rule\u00a0164(2) annexed to the communication under Art. 94(3) (see H\u2011II,\u00a02.3).\nIf search fees are not paid in due time under Rule\u00a0164(2), a communication under Art.\u00a094(3) and Rule\u00a071(1)\u00a0and Rule\u00a071(2) or under Rule\u00a071(3) will be issued and the examining division will require deletion from the claims of any subject-matter that was not searched either because a search fee under Rule\u00a0164(2) was not paid (see\u00a0H\u2011II,\u00a06) or for a different reason (see H\u2011IV,\u00a04). Before the patent is granted, this subject-matter should be either deleted from the description and drawings or indicated as not forming part of the claimed invention (see F\u2011IV,\u00a04.3(iii)).\nA communication under Rule\u00a0164(2)(b) deals with all objections for each of the inventions searched in accordance with Rule\u00a0164(2). For claims relating to inventions already searched by the EPO in the international phase that have been amended but still lack unity, it is sufficient to argue in detail why lack of unity is still present. The communication, where appropriate, further requests the applicant to limit the application to a single searched invention (see\u00a0Rule\u00a0164(2)(c)).\nIt follows from Rule\u00a0164(2)(b) and Rule\u00a0164(2)(c) that the special procedure under Rule\u00a0164(2) as set out in H\u2011II,\u00a02.3 ends upon expiry of the time limit set in the communication issued under Rule\u00a0164(2)(b). This means that the applicant's right to make amendments of their own volition ends upon expiry of that time limit.\nFurthermore, the special procedure as set out in F\u2011V,\u00a07.1(iv), which exempts amendments from the requirements of Rule\u00a0137(5), first sentence, ends upon expiry of the time limit under Rule\u00a0161(1). Such amendments will result in an invitation under Rule\u00a0164(2)(a) and allow the applicant to obtain a search of unsearched subject-matter referred to in Rule\u00a0137(5). However, any amendments submitted after expiry of the time limit under Rule\u00a0161(1) are subject to the requirements of Rule\u00a0137(5), first sentence (see H\u2011IV,\u00a04.1.2).\nThe EPO's obligations under Rule\u00a0164(2) are fulfilled and the applicant's rights under this rule are exhausted once a single communication under Rule\u00a0164(2) has been sent. It follows that in cases of cascading non-unity no (further) invitation under Rule\u00a0164(2) is sent. The same applies if, during the examination procedure, claims are added or existing claims amended so that they relate to non-searched inventions.\nExceptional cases may arise where the following sequence of events has occurred in the international phase:\n(i)The EPO acted as ISA in the international phase\u00a0\n(ii)The EPO acting as ISA invited the applicant to pay one or more additional international search fees in accordance with Art.\u00a017(3)(a)\u00a0PCT and Rule\u00a040\u00a0PCT (due to a lack of unity according to Rule\u00a013\u00a0PCT)\n(iii)The applicant paid at least one such additional search fee\u00a0\n(iv)The additional search or searches led to a further objection as to a lack of unity a posteriori (a cascading lack of unity), resulting in one of the inventions identified in the invitation under Art.\u00a017(3)(a)\u00a0PCT and Rule\u00a040\u00a0PCT being further subdivided and resulting in sub-inventions not originally identified in that invitation\n(v)The EPO did not search all such sub-inventions.\u00a0\nIn the above case, the EPO will invite the applicant to pay search fees for any such unsearched sub-inventions in the claims that are to form the basis for examination on expiry of the six-month period under Rule\u00a0161(1), in accordance with Rule\u00a0164(2).\nWhere the EPO acted as SISA in accordance with Rule\u00a045bis.9\u00a0PCT, it may make a finding of a lack of unity of the international application according to Rule\u00a045bis.6(a)\u00a0PCT. However, in the procedure before the SISA, the applicant cannot pay additional supplementary international search fees, and the supplementary international search report will be directed only to the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims (Rule\u00a045bis.6(a)\u00a0PCT). Where such an application contains unsearched inventions in the claims that are to form the basis for examination on expiry of the six-month period under Rule\u00a0161(1), a communication under Rule\u00a0164(2) is issued allowing the applicant to have these inventions searched upon payment of search fees and to pursue one of them in the examination proceedings.\nRule\u00a0164(2)(b) provides for a right to amend the application in response to the results of any search under Rule\u00a0164(2). This means that applicants may make amendments of their own volition once in response to the communication under Art.\u00a094(3) to which the search results under Rule\u00a0164(2) are annexed (H\u2011II,\u00a02.3).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part C \u2013 Guidelines for Procedural Aspects of Substantive Examination", "chapter": "Chapter III \u2013 The first stage of examination", "title": "3.2 Relation to unity in search; limitation to searched invention\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a082": "An objection of lack of unity of invention, if applicable, should already have been raised at the search stage.

In response to such an invitation, applicants must clearly indicate which searched invention they wish to prosecute further.

However, where there is a reasonable prospect that an additional invitation to overcome the objections could lead to a grant, the examiner will send a further written communication or contact the applicant by telephone. The examiner may also make suggestions on how to overcome the raised objections (see B\u2011XI,\u00a03.8 and C\u2011III,\u00a04.1.2).\nIf examination of the applicant's reply shows that they have not dealt with all the main objections in their reply, it may be appropriate to draw the deficiencies to their attention, e.g.\u00a0by telephone. But if no positive reaction is to be expected, the examiner should consider recommending to the other members of the examining division that the application be refused immediately (again provided that at least one communication has been sent in examination proceedings).\nIf substantial differences of opinion exist, the issues are generally best dealt with in writing. If, however, there seems to be confusion about points in dispute, e.g.\u00a0the applicant seems to have misunderstood the examiner's arguments or the applicant's own arguments are unclear, then a consultation may be useful.

However, within the examining division responsible for the application, one member (the first examiner member) will, as a general rule, be entrusted to carry out all substantive examination work up to the point of a decision to grant a patent, issue a summons to oral proceedings or refuse the application. While acting on behalf of the examining division in all communications with the applicant up to that point, this examiner may confer informally with the other members of the division at any time on specific points of doubt or difficulty. The term \"examiner\" as used in this part of the Guidelines is normally understood to mean the \"first\" examiner member.\nAs stated above, the examiner first member may seek the advice of other members of the examining division at any stage in the examination. However, there will come a point when it becomes appropriate for them to refer the case formally to the other members of the examining division. This will be when they consider the case to be in order to proceed to grant or, alternatively, where there seems no possibility of an amendment to overcome their objections or where the applicant has not overcome these objections, and when they consider the case to be in order to proceed to refusal. There are also other circumstances in which reference to the examining division is appropriate, e.g.\u00a0oral proceedings may be suggested by the examiner or requested by the applicant because an impasse has been reached. In considering whether to refer the application to the division, the examiner should be guided by the principle stated in C\u2011IV,\u00a03.\nPrimary examiners The first member should also bear in mind that when they issue a communication they do so in the name of the division, and the applicant is entitled to assume that if the examiner had doubts as to the views of the rest of the division, they would have discussed the matter with them beforehand.\nAlthough the examining division assumes ultimate responsibility for an application as soon as that application passes to it under Rule\u00a010, formal matters are normally dealt with by a formalities officer (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12\u00a0December\u00a02013, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02014,\u00a0A6; OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02015, A104). Examiners should not spend time checking the work of the Receiving Section or the formalities officer. However, they should refer an application to the formalities officer for further consideration if they believe the formalities report to be incorrect or incomplete.\nIf required by specific circumstances (e.g.\u00a0sickness), an application may be reallocated to another examiner/examining division. In such cases, the decision to reallocate will be taken by the line manager. The director is responsible for deciding whether the dossier is to be fully reallocated to a new examining division or whether a single member of the division is to be replaced.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part C \u2013 Guidelines for Procedural Aspects of Substantive Examination", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Work within the examining division", "title": "2.

In this event, by derogation from Art.\u00a0118, the previous patent proprietor and the person making the request are not deemed to be joint patent proprietors unless both so request. The aim of this provision is to afford new patent proprietors the opportunity of defending themselves against the opposition as they see fit (see\u00a0D\u2011VII,\u00a03.2 as regards the conduct of the opposition proceedings in such cases).\n", "Article\u00a020": "The Legal Division is responsible for decisions in respect of entries in the Register of European Patents (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 21\u00a0November\u00a02013, OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02013,\u00a0600).\nIt is to be noted that a person who files two different notices of opposition to the same granted patent acquires party status as opponent only once (T\u00a09/00). Two filings by the same opponent within the opposition period that individually are not admissible but taken together comply with Art.\u00a099(1) and Rule\u00a076 are considered as one admissible opposition (T\u00a0774/05; for a joint opposition, see\u00a0D\u2011I,\u00a04).\nMultiple oppositions are dealt with in a single set of proceedings (see E\u2011III,\u00a06). When there are multiple opponents and/or proprietors as parties to a single opposition proceedings, it is normally appropriate to deal with all relevant issues (including e.g.\u00a0admissibility of one of the oppositions, see D\u2011IV,\u00a05.5) when taking the final decision, e.g.\u00a0during one oral proceedings (also see E\u2011III,\u00a06). The legal framework is defined by the sum of the statements of the extent to which the patent is opposed and by the grounds for opposition submitted and substantiated in the notices of opposition provided by each opponent. If one of the oppositions is admissible, but is later withdrawn, prejudicial grounds put forward in said opposition are generally examined by the opposition division of its own motion. If one of the oppositions is inadmissible, and provided at least one admissible opposition has been filed, the opposition division will consider of its own motion any prima facie relevant art cited in the inadmissible opposition (see D\u2011V,\u00a02.2).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part D \u2013 Guidelines for Opposition and Limitation/Revocation Procedures", "chapter": "Chapter I \u2013 General remarks", "title": "7.

Depending on its content, a document (provisionally) excluded from file inspection and any communication concerning a request for its exclusion from file inspection may be forwarded to the other party or parties (Rule\u00a081(2)).

For example, a scientific article\u00a0is usually easily retrievable, and its copyright is assigned to the editor. In contrast, a third-party company brochure is not easily retrievable.

The overriding consideration in this context is the disclosed content of the European patent specification, that is to say what a person skilled in the art is able to derive directly and unambiguously from the explicit and implicit disclosure in the patent claims, description and drawings, if any, without using inventiveness. Pursuant to Art.\u00a0100(b), the patent has to disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by persons skilled in the art. If the patent specification does not disclose the invention sufficiently clearly to enable it to be carried out over the full scope of the claim in accordance with Art.\u00a0100(b), this may be remedied, provided the original documents contained a sufficient disclosure, but subject to the condition that, as required under Art.\u00a0123(2), the subject-matter of the European patent does not extend beyond the content of the application as filed and, as required under Art.\u00a0123(3), the protection conferred is not extended.\nThe skilled person wishing to implement the claimed invention reads the claims in a technically sensible manner. An objection of insufficient disclosure of the invention is therefore not to be based on embodiments that are meaningless and not consistent with the teaching of the application as a whole (see\u00a0T\u00a0521/12).\nThere is normally no deficiency under Art.\u00a0100(b) if a feature which is essential for performance of the invention is missing from the claim but is disclosed in the description and/or drawings.

Thus, the deletion of an independent claim with its dependent claims or the deletion of a dependent claim leaving the independent claims and other dependent claims intact does not permit examination of the remaining claims for compliance with Art.\u00a084.\nA claim amended during opposition proceedings is not subject to examination for compliance with Art.\u00a084 if it results from\n(i)inserting a complete dependent claim as granted into an independent claim;\u00a0\n(ii)combining one of several alternative embodiments of the dependent claim as granted with the independent claim as granted;\u00a0\n(iii)deleting wording from a granted claim (whether independent or dependent), whereby its scope is narrowed but a pre-existing lack of compliance with Art.\u00a084 is left intact (as exemplified by T\u00a0301/87); or\n(iv)deleting optional features from a granted claim (whether independent or dependent).\u00a0\nHowever, an amended claim is to be examined for compliance with Art.\u00a084:\n(v)if features are taken from the description and inserted into a granted claim by way of amendment; or\u00a0\n(vi)if a feature from a dependent claim as granted is introduced into an independent claim as granted and this feature was previously connected with other features of that dependent claim and an alleged lack of compliance with Art.\u00a084 is introduced by the amendment.\nCorrespondingly, the description of the patent may be examined for compliance with the requirements of Art.\u00a084 only when, and then only to the extent that, an amendment of the patent introduces non-compliance with Art.\u00a084.

However, examiners must carefully consider on a case-by-case basis whether citing a new document would introduce a new line of argument. At an early stage in the procedure, they must consider sending a further communication before issuing any summons if a new document needs to be cited.

This must be done at the earliest opportunity. When such evidence is such as could have been put forward at an earlier stage it is for the competent department to consider whether it is expedient (see\u00a0E\u2011VI,\u00a02) to allow the new evidence to be introduced.\nIt is generally desirable for parties to produce evidence in respect of all the facts alleged in support of their case, in order, for example, to show whether a particular technique was generally known to industry or whether there was any prejudice against a particular technique.\nFacts adduced by a party will, however, normally be deemed true, even without supporting evidence, if it is clear that no doubts exist concerning them, if they do not contradict one another or if no objection is raised. In such cases the facts need not be supported by evidence.\nThere will however be occasions, particularly in opposition proceedings, in which the arguments of the party or parties must be supported by evidence. This will for example be the case where reference is made to prior art, for instance in the form of an oral description, a use or perhaps a company publication and there is some doubt as to whether, and if so when, such prior art was made available to the public.\nThe means of evidence which are admissible in proceedings before the EPO are (non-exhaustively) listed in Art.\u00a0117(1):\n\u2013\u00a0production of documents;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0hearing the parties;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0hearing witnesses;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0sworn statements in writing;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0requests for information, for instance from a publisher concerning the date of publication of a book\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0opinions by experts (see\u00a0E\u2011IV,\u00a01.8.1); and\n\u2013\u00a0inspection.\u00a0\nThe most appropriate way of obtaining evidence in the individual case depends on the facts which have to be proven and on the availability of the evidence. To prove prior use in an opposition, the opponents usually offer as evidence the production of documents, the hearing of witnesses or parties, or they present sworn statements in writing. It is at the opposition division's discretion to evaluate this evidence, there being no fixed rules as to how any category of evidence is to be judged (for the evaluation of evidence, see\u00a0E\u2011IV,\u00a04).\nIf the documents produced (e.g.\u00a0patent documents) leave no doubt as to their contents and date of availability to the public and are more relevant for the patent in suit than other evidence offered, reasons of procedural efficiency may lead the opposition division to not pursue the other evidence at first.\nIf the testimony of a witness is offered, the opposition division may decide to hear this person in order to verify the facts for which this witness is brought forward, e.g.\u00a0the prior use of the claimed product in an undertaking or the existence of an obligation to secrecy. For adequate substantiation the notice of opposition must make clear these facts, as witnesses are meant to serve for corroboration of facts brought forward, not for supplying these facts in place of the opponent. The above applies likewise to hearing the parties (see also E\u2011IV,\u00a01.6).\nThe \"sworn statements in writing\" referred to in Art.\u00a0117(1)(g) are unknown in some national legal systems, which instead have their own instruments (see\u00a0T\u00a0558/95).\nWhether a written statement (\"affidavit\") is made under oath or not is only one of the criteria applied by the opposition division in its evaluation of the evidence adduced. Apart from its relevance for the case, other criteria are the relationship between the person making the statement and the parties to the proceedings, the personal interest of that person, the context in which the statement was made, etc. Such a statement does not go beyond its literal content and does not allow the opposition division to assess the associated or background factors. If the alleged facts are contested by the other party, the opposition division does not generally base its decision on such a statement, but summons the person making the statement as a witness, if so offered by the party. The ensuing hearing of the witness allows the opposition division and the parties to put questions to the witness and thus enables the opposition division to establish the facts on the basis of that person's testimony. If that person is not offered as a witness, the opposition division will not pursue this evidence further.\nInspection will enable direct observations to be made and direct impressions to be formed of the object or process concerned. It may, for example, involve the demonstration of a product or process requested by the applicant or proprietor of the patent to substantiate the method of operation of the subject-matter of the patent where this is disputed by the examining or opposition division.\nEvidence in the form of documents normally stays on the file. Only exceptionally and on reasoned request can documents filed as evidence be returned unconsidered, e.g.\u00a0if they were third-party statements filed in breach of a confidentiality agreement and the other parties agree to the request (see\u00a0T\u00a0760/89).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part E \u2013 Guidelines on General Procedural Matters", "chapter": "Chapter IV \u2013 Taking and conservation of evidence", "title": "1.3 Taking of evidence\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a0117": "The department responsible for the taking of evidence in the form of a hearing of witnesses, parties and experts will, in substantive examination and opposition proceedings, be the division before which the taking of evidence as part of oral proceedings would normally take place.

Note in this respect that according to G\u00a01/95 and G\u00a07/95, Art.\u00a0100(a) does not constitute one single ground for opposition, but has to be considered a collection of individual grounds for opposition, i.e.\u00a0individual legal bases for objection to the maintenance of a patent. This\u00a0applies not only to distinctly different objections, such as subject-matter which is not patentable (Art.\u00a052(2)) as compared to subject-matter which is not capable of industrial application (Art.\u00a057), but also to an objection for lack of novelty as opposed to an objection for lack of inventive step.\nNew arguments based on facts, evidence and grounds constituting the legal and factual framework of the opposition cannot be disregarded.\nIn deciding whether to admit facts, evidence or grounds for opposition not filed in due time, their relevance to the decision, the state of the procedure and the reasons for belated submission are to be considered. If examination of late-filed grounds for opposition, late-filed facts or late-filed evidence reveals without any further investigation (i.e.\u00a0prima\u00a0facie) that they are relevant, i.e.\u00a0that the basis of the envisaged decision would be changed, then the competent department has to take such grounds, facts or evidence into consideration no matter what stage the procedure has reached and whatever the reasons for belated submission.

Admission of such requests could give rise to a postponement of oral proceedings and to a decision on apportionment of costs.\nExamples of possible abuse of the proceedings would be:\n\u2013\u00a0The patent proprietor introduces at short notice a proliferation of auxiliary requests which are not a reaction to the course of the proceedings.\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0The opponent knowingly abstains from raising an assertion of public prior use based on its own activities until late in the proceedings, even though the evidence in its support had become fully available earlier (see\u00a0T\u00a0534/89).\n\u2013\u00a0The applicant or patent proprietor presents a large number of requests or incomplete variants of requests and invites the division to choose, shifting the responsibility for determining the content of the application or patent to the division. It is the duty of any party to proceedings to make its own case and to formulate its own requests (see T\u00a0446/00).\nConcerning the question of whether the parties can reasonably be expected to familiarise themselves in the time available with the new facts or evidence or the proposed amendments:\n\u2013\u00a0It may only become apparent in the oral proceedings that the pending request submitted to overcome grounds for opposition is not allowable under the EPC. The opponent must always expect to have to discuss subject-matter based on dependent claims as granted if they are reasonable in number.\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0The proprietor is in principle free to withdraw previously submitted amendments and defend the patent as granted unless this would constitute an abuse of the proceedings.\u00a0\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part E \u2013 Guidelines on General Procedural Matters", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Examination by the EPO of its own motion; facts, evidence or grounds not\u00a0submitted\u00a0in due time; observations by third parties", "title": "2.2.4 Right to be heard\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a0113": "Generally, the parties must be heard before the division decides on whether or not to admit late-filed submissions. \nFor instance, if the opponent introduces a new ground for opposition during oral proceedings, they must always be granted the right to be heard. This means that the division must give the parties the opportunity to put forward arguments and duly consider them before deciding on the admissibility of the new ground. Similarly, where the opponent files pertinent new material, the patent proprietor must be given a chance to present comments and submit amendments. If the opposition division approves the introduction of new facts or evidence and if the other parties have not had sufficient time to study them, it grants, where easily comprehensible subject-matter is involved, the parties an opportunity to familiarise themselves with it, possibly by briefly interrupting the oral proceedings. If this is not feasible, the other parties must, upon request, be given the opportunity to comment in the proceedings subsequent to the oral proceedings, where appropriate in a further set of oral proceedings. Where possible, however, oral proceedings will not be adjourned. \nWhere possible, legal commentaries, decisions (of a board of appeal, for example) and reports on legal decisions which are to be referred to in oral proceedings must be notified to the opposition division and the other parties in good time before the proceedings. They may, however, be quoted or submitted for the first time in the oral proceedings themselves if the opposition division agrees after consulting the parties.\nThe reasons for the decision on the admissibility of late-filed facts, evidence and requests have to be provided in the written decision and must not come as a surprise.

The omitted act must be completed within this period.\nWhere the \"cause of non-compliance with the time limit\" involved some error in the carrying out of the party's intention to comply with the time limit, the removal of the cause of non-compliance occurs on the date on which the person responsible for the application is made aware of the fact that a time limit has not been observed or ought to have noticed the error if all due care had been taken. The removal of the cause of non-compliance is a matter of fact which has to be determined in the circumstances of each individual case. In the absence of circumstances to the contrary, where a communication under Rule\u00a0112(1) has been duly sent, it may be assumed that the removal was effected by receipt of this communication (see\u00a0J\u00a027/90).\nUnlike the time limit for other cases as described above, a request for re-establishment in respect of the priority period (Art.\u00a087(1)) or the period for filing a petition for review by the Enlarged Board of Appeal (Art.\u00a0112a(4)) must be filed within two\u00a0months of expiry of the relevant period.\nA request for re-establishment is not deemed to be filed until after the fee for the re-establishment of rights has been paid.\nThe principles regarding unitary and independent procedural acts described in E\u2011VIII,\u00a02 apply mutatis\u00a0mutandis to establishing the number of requests for re-establishment of rights, in particular for establishing the relevant fees to be paid. Where one unitary procedural act is omitted by not performing one or more actions forming that act, only one fee for re-establishment is due. Where several independent procedural acts are omitted, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn, a fee for re-establishment is due for each omitted act.\nThese principles also apply to cases where re-establishment of rights must be requested in respect of the time limit(s) for requesting further processing (see\u00a0Rule\u00a0136(3)). In such cases, the number of unobserved time limits, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn and requiring a request for further processing, determines the number of requests for re-establishment and the corresponding number of fees for re-establishment.\nExample 1\nAn international application comprises more than 35\u00a0pages and was published in a language other than an official language of the EPO. The acts required for entry into the European phase upon expiry of the 31-month period under Rule\u00a0159(1) were omitted. Due to their different legal nature, the individual acts required under Rule\u00a0159(1) do not form a unitary procedural step but are legally independent and subject to independent time limits. The table below provides a schematic illustration regarding further processing and re-establishment of rights (for information on the remedies available for non-observance of the time limits under Rule\u00a0159(1), see the individual sections under E\u2011IX,\u00a02).\nBox\u00a0I of the table lists the number of independent unobserved time limits. Box\u00a0II indicates the fee for further processing corresponding to each unobserved time limit. Box\u00a0III provides the fee for re-establishment corresponding to each unobserved time limit.\nIn the example, for a request for further processing to be allowed, completion of the omitted acts (i.e.\u00a0all acts that were to be performed within the 31-month period) and payment of five fees for further processing (two of which comprise two fees) are required within the two-month period under Rule\u00a0135(1). If that period is missed, the applicant may request re-establishment of rights in respect of the period. The request requires completion of the omitted acts and payment of the corresponding number of fees for re-establishment of rights within the period under Rule\u00a0136(1). The omitted acts are those that were to be performed within the 31-month\u00a0period and payment of the corresponding five fees for further processing. Payment of five fees for re-establishment of rights corresponds to the number of five independent fees for further processing.\nOmitted acts\n\nTime limits missed\n(box\u00a0I)\n\nNumber of fees for further processing\n(box\u00a0II)\n\nNumber of fees for re-establishment\n(box\u00a0III)\n\n\nFiling of the translation\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nPayment of the filing fee\n\n1 (unitary)\n\n1 (comprising 50% of the filing fee and 50% of the additional fee)\n\n1\n\nPayment of the additional fee for an application comprising more than 35\u00a0pages\n\nPayment of the designation fee\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nPayment of the search fee\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFiling of the request for examination\n\n1 (unitary)\n\n1 (comprising a flat fee and 50% of the examination fee)\n\n1\n\nPayment of the examination fee\n\nResulting number of fees to be paid\n\n5 non-observed time limits\n\n5 fees for further processing, 2 of them comprising 2\u00a0fees\n\n5 fees for re-establishment \n\n\u00a0\nExample\u00a02\nThe applicant missed the time limit for requesting further processing in respect of the time limit for replying to a communication from the examining division under Art.\u00a094(3) as well as the time limit to pay the renewal fee with the additional fee. As these time limits expire independently of one another and both have been missed by the applicant, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn, a request for re-establishment has to be filed in respect of each unobserved time limit (J\u00a026/95). In such cases, a fee for re-establishment has to be paid in respect of each request. In the case of independent time limits, in particular where they expire on different dates, the reasons for missing them and the date of removal of the cause of non-compliance may be different.\nExample\u00a03\nAfter a decision to refuse by the examining division, the applicant missed both the time limit for filing the notice and the time limit for filing the statement of grounds of appeal. Both time limits were missed for the same reason. Despite two time limits being missed, only one re-establishment fee has to be paid as both periods were triggered by the same event, i.e. the notification of the decision, and both time limits were missed on the same grounds. In such a case, re-establishment in respect of both periods has to be examined together and, as the result would inevitably be the same in both cases, one re-establishment fee is considered to be sufficient.\nIf the time limits for filing the notice and the grounds were missed for different reasons, there would be no causal connection and two fees for re-establishment would have to be paid.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part E \u2013 Guidelines on General Procedural Matters", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Time limits, loss of rights, further and accelerated processing and re-establishment of rights", "title": "3.1.4 Substantiation of the request\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part E \u2013 Guidelines on General Procedural Matters", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Time limits, loss of rights, further and accelerated processing and re-establishment of rights", "title": "3.2 Merit of the request\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a0122": "Applicants can have their rights re-established only if they show that they were unable to observe a time limit vis-\u00e0-vis the EPO in spite of all due care required by the circumstances having been taken. The obligation to exercise due care must be considered in the light of the situation as it stood before the missed time limit expired. \"All due care\" means all reasonable care, i.e.\u00a0the standard of care that the notional reasonably competent patentee, applicant or representative would employ in all the relevant circumstances (see T\u00a030/90).\nFor cases where the cause of non-compliance with a time limit involves some error in the carrying out of the party's intention to comply with the time limit, all due care is considered to have been taken if non-compliance with the time limit results either from exceptional circumstances or from an isolated mistake within a normally satisfactory monitoring system.\nA finding of exceptional circumstances justifying the re-establishment of rights is dependent on the individual facts of the case. Examples include inter\u00a0alia organisational upheavals and sudden serious illnesses. In such cases, the requesters must show not only the existence of those circumstances, but also that they took all due care, e.g.\u00a0by carefully preparing the reorganisation or by having an effective staff substitution system.\nWhere an isolated mistake within a normally satisfactory monitoring system is alleged, the relevant party must show that the monitoring system normally works well. Such a system must include an independent, effective cross-check mechanism. However, this requirement does not apply to relatively small entities/patent departments (see T\u00a0166/87 and J\u00a011/03).\nThe duty to exercise all due care applies first and foremost to the applicants and then, by virtue of delegation, to the representative duly entrusted by the applicant to act on their behalf in prosecuting the application (see J\u00a03/93). The obligations of the applicant and those of their representative are clearly distinct and depend on the relationship between them (see T\u00a0112/89 and J\u00a019/04). In this regard, the scope of the mandate and any express instructions given to the representative are taken into account.\nApplicants are entitled to rely on their representative. To the extent that applicants are on notice that instructions are required in order to meet a time limit, they have however a duty to take all due care in the circumstances to meet the time limit (see T\u00a0381/93). The fact that the professional representative has acted correctly does not exempt applicants from suffering the consequences of their own mistakes or negligence.\nEuropean representatives are responsible in the procedure before the EPO and must be presumed to be supervising their own work continuously (see T\u00a01095/06). When professional representatives have been instructed by their client to perform a particular procedural action and do not receive in due time the necessary additional instructions or required means, they must in principle take all necessary measures to try to obtain these instructions from their client and ascertain their true wishes (see T\u00a0112/89 and J\u00a019/04).\nProfessional representatives can delegate routine tasks, such as typing, posting letters, noting time limits or checking due dates, to assistants. In those cases, the same strict standard of care is not expected of the assistant as is demanded of the representative himself. The representative must however show that the assistants have been carefully selected, duly instructed and periodically supervised (see J\u00a05/80 and T\u00a0439/06).\nIf the applicants entrust a further party with taking care of their application matters, e.g.\u00a0a non-European representative or a fee payment agency, it has to be established that such a party has taken the due care required of an applicant for or proprietor of a European patent (see J\u00a03/88). In particular, a non-European representative must also show that a reliable system for the monitoring of time limits was in place when the time limit was missed (see\u00a0J\u00a04/07).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part E \u2013 Guidelines on General Procedural Matters", "chapter": "Chapter VIII \u2013 Time limits, loss of rights, further and accelerated processing and re-establishment of rights", "title": "3.3 Decision on re-establishment of rights\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Rule\u00a0136": "The department competent to decide on the omitted act is also competent to decide on the request for re-establishment of rights.

The EPO registers a transfer of rights in respect of a pending European patent application (see\u00a0A\u2011IV,\u00a01.1.1 and J\u00a010/93) in the European Patent Register on request, upon fulfilment of the prerequisites of Rule\u00a022. The request is not deemed to have been filed until an administrative fee has been paid. The amount of the fee is determined by the latest schedule of fees and expenses of the EPO (see epo.org).\nWhere the request relates to multiple applications, a separate fee has to be paid for each application.\nWith effect from the entry into force of amended Rule\u00a022(1) on 1\u00a0April 2024, the conditions under which payment of an administrative fee is due is laid down by the President of the EPO. \nRule\u00a022 furthermore requires the production of documents providing evidence of such a transfer. Any kind of written evidence suitable for proving the transfer is admissible. This includes formal documentary proof such as the instrument of transfer itself (the original or a copy thereof) or other official documents or extracts thereof, provided that they immediately verify the transfer (J\u00a012/00). Art.\u00a072 requires that, for an assignment, the signatures of the parties appear on the documents submitted as evidence of the transfer. Assignment documents filed electronically (see A\u2011II,\u00a01.1.1 A\u2011II,\u00a01.2.2) may, instead of handwritten signatures, bear qualified electronic signatures (see notice from the EPO dated 22\u00a0October\u00a02021; OJ\u00a0EPO\u00a02021,\u00a0A86).\nWith effect from the entry into force of amended Rule\u00a022(1) on 1\u00a0April 2024, electronic signatures as determined by the President of the EPO are accepted on assignment documents.\nWhere a document is signed on behalf of a legal person, only such persons as are entitled to sign by law, by the legal person's articles of association or equivalent or by a special mandate may do so. National law applies in that respect. In all cases, an indication of the signatory's entitlement to sign, e.g.\u00a0his/her position within the legal entity where the entitlement to sign results directly from such a position, is to be given. The contracting parties have to ensure that the signatories are duly authorised in accordance with the national law applicable to sign such a document. The EPO, however, reserves the right to request documentary proof of the signatory's authority to sign if the circumstances of a particular case necessitate this. In such cases, if the evidence presented is found to be unsatisfactory, the EPO informs the party requesting the transfer accordingly and invites them to remedy the stated deficiency within a given time limit. Where the entitlement results from a special authorisation, this authorisation (a copy thereof, which need not be certified) has to be submitted in every case. The EPO will in particular examine whether the signatory is empowered to enter into a legally binding contract on behalf of the legal entity.\nAs a general rule, the authorisation to represent a party in proceedings before the EPO within the meaning of Rule\u00a0152, be it an individual or a general authorisation, is not as such considered to empower the representative to enter into such a contract.\nIf the evidence presented is found to be unsatisfactory, the EPO informs the party requesting the transfer accordingly, and invites it to remedy the stated deficiencies within a given time limit.\nIf the request complies with the requirements of Rule\u00a022(1), the transfer is registered with the date on which the request, the required evidence or the fee has been received by the EPO, whichever is the latest. In case of a minor deficiency, i.e.\u00a0if all requirements were present but not fulfilled completely (e.g. the request was signed but the name and/or position of the person signing were missing), once rectified the effective date is the date of receipt of the original request for registration.\n", "Rule\u00a022": "On the above date, the transfer becomes effective vis-\u00e0-vis the EPO, i.e.\u00a0from that date the newly registered applicant is entitled to exercise the right to the European patent application in proceedings before the EPO (Art.\u00a060(3)). If the transfer was for certain designated states only, Art.\u00a0118 applies.\n", "Article\u00a020": "Once a transfer has been duly entered in the European Patent Register, the registration cannot be undone, even if it appears that one or more requirements were actually not fulfilled for reasons not apparent at the time when the transfer was registered by the EPO, e.g.\u00a0where doubts arise later as to the entitlement of the person signing on behalf of one of the parties to enter such a transfer agreement (see decisions J\u00a016/14 to J\u00a022/14). The original status quo is no longer restored until the valid legal situation has been established. In the meantime, proceedings may have to be stayed under Rule\u00a014 or 78 until it is clear who the legitimate applicant/proprietor is.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part E \u2013 Guidelines on General Procedural Matters", "chapter": "Chapter XIV \u2013 Registration of changes of name, transfers, licences and other rights", "title": "4.

Such citations typically relate to well-known tests for measuring certain parameters mentioned in the description or to the definitions of terms of established meaning that are used in the application. Usually they are not relevant for assessing the patentability of the claimed invention, unless for example they contain relevant information which the applicant does not mention in the description.\nAcknowledgment of prior art relevant to the dependent claims only is generally not required. If the applicant indicates that subject-matter initially cited as prior art is only \"in-house state of the art\", such prior art may not be used in the assessment of novelty and inventive step (see T\u00a0654/92,\u00a0Reasons\u00a04, and T\u00a01001/98,\u00a0Reasons\u00a03). However, it may be allowed to remain in the description, provided the fact that it is only \"in-house state of the art\" is made clear.\n", "Article\u00a0123": "The description should also mention any background art of which the applicant is aware, and which can be regarded as useful for understanding the invention and its relationship to the prior art; identification of documents reflecting such art, especially patent specifications, should preferably be included. This applies in particular to the background art corresponding to the first (\"prior art\") portion of the independent claim or claims (see\u00a0F\u2011IV,\u00a02.2).\nIn principle, when filing an application the applicant should cite in the description the closest prior art known to them. It may happen that the prior art cited by the applicant is not the closest existing for the claimed invention. Therefore, the documents cited in the application as filed do not necessarily describe the known innovations closest to the claimed invention, but may in fact constitute more distantly related prior art.\nThe insertion into the statement of prior art of references to documents identified during examination may be necessary to put the invention into proper perspective (see\u00a0T\u00a011/82). For instance, while the originally\u00a0filed description of prior art may give the impression that the inventor has developed the invention from a certain point, the cited documents may show that certain stages in, or aspects of, this alleged development were already known. In such a case the examining division requires a reference to these documents and a brief summary of the relevant contents. The subsequent inclusion of such a summary in the description does not contravene Art.\u00a0123(2). The latter merely lays down that, if the application is amended, for example by limiting it in the light of additional information on the background art, its subject-matter must not extend beyond the content of the application as filed. But the subject-matter of the European patent application within the meaning of Art.\u00a0123(2) is to be understood \u2013 starting off from the prior art \u2013 as comprising those features which, in the framework of the disclosure required by Art.\u00a083, relate to the invention (see also H\u2011IV,\u00a02.1). In addition, relevant prior-art documents not cited in the original application may be subsequently acknowledged in the description even if these were known to the applicant at the time of filing (T\u00a02321/08 and H\u2011IV,\u00a02.2.7).\nReferences to the prior art introduced after filing must be purely factual.

The first is where the successful performance of the invention is dependent on chance. That is to say, the skilled person, in following the instructions for carrying out the invention, finds either that the alleged results of the invention are unrepeatable or that success in obtaining these results is achieved in a totally unreliable way. Sufficiency of disclosure cannot be acknowledged if the skilled person has to carry out a research programme based on trial and error to reproduce the results of the invention, with limited chances of success (T\u00a038/11,\u00a0Reasons\u00a02.6). An example where this may arise is a microbiological process involving mutations. Such a case is to be distinguished from one where repeated success is assured even though accompanied by a proportion of failures, as can arise e.g.\u00a0in the manufacture of small magnetic cores or electronic components. In this latter case, provided the satisfactory parts can be readily sorted by a non-destructive testing procedure, no objection arises under Art.\u00a083. Another example can be found in the field of artificial intelligence if the mathematical methods and the training datasets are disclosed in insufficient detail to reproduce the technical effect over the whole range claimed. Such a lack of detail may result in a disclosure that is more like an invitation to a research programme (see also G\u2011II,\u00a03.3.1).\nThe second instance is where successful performance of the invention is inherently impossible because it would be contrary to well-established physical laws \u2013 this applies e.g.\u00a0to a perpetual motion machine. If the claims for such a machine are directed to its function, and not merely to its structure, an objection arises not only under Art.\u00a083 but also under Art.\u00a052(1) in that the invention is not \"susceptible of industrial application\" (see\u00a0G\u2011III,\u00a01).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part F \u2013 The European Patent Application", "chapter": "Chapter III \u2013 Sufficiency of disclosure", "title": "4.

In contrast, bracketed expressions with a generally accepted meaning are allowable, e.g. \"(meth)acrylate\" which is known as an abbreviation for \"acrylate and methacrylate\".

Correspondence may be found for example in alternative solutions, or interrelated features, e.g. the interaction between a plug and a socket causing a releasable electrical connection, or in a causal relationship such as a step in a manufacturing process that causes a certain structural feature in a product. For example, an application might include two sets of claims, one comprising a metal spring, and another comprising a block of rubber. The metal spring and block of rubber may be considered to be corresponding technical features as they both achieve the same technical effect of resilience.\nIn contrast, features that are not shared, i.e. features that only appear in some but not in other claims, cannot be part of the single general inventive concept.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part F \u2013 The European Patent Application", "chapter": "Chapter V \u2013 Unity of invention", "title": "2.1 Insufficient grounds for lack of unity\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a084": "When determining unity of invention, a finding of lack of clarity of the claims is on its own not sufficient grounds for a finding of lack of unity.\nNormally, too, the sequence of the claims has no impact on the determination of unity of invention.

The EPO will not consider this question unless there is evidence of the existence of a still earlier application as, for example, in the case of a United States continuation-in-part application. Where it is clear that a still earlier application for the same subject-matter exists, and where the priority right is important because of intervening prior art (see\u00a0F\u2011VI,\u00a02.1), the applicant is required to establish by evidence from an appropriate authority (normally a national patent office) that there were no rights outstanding in the still earlier application in respect of the subject-matter of the application being examined.\nExamples of applications that cannot be recognised as a \"first application\" within the meaning of Art.\u00a087(4) are:\n(i)US applications which are a \"continuation\" of a previous application (\"con\");\u00a0\n(ii)US applications which are a \"continuation in part\" of a previous application (\"cip\"), in so far as the subject-matter in question was already disclosed in the original US application;\u00a0\n(iii)national applications claiming priority from a previous national application or national utility model.\u00a0\nIn the case of US con or cip applications, the first sentence of the description reads as follows: \"This application is a continuation in part (continuation) of Serial Number .... filed .....\".

If GB1 is withdrawn, abandoned or refused, without being open to public inspection and without having served as a basis for claiming a right of priority, the mere reference to it under Rule\u00a040(1)(c) does not amount to an outstanding right within the meaning of Art.\u00a087(4).

Subject-matter of a European application will be accorded the priority date of the earliest priority application which discloses it.\nIf, for instance, the European application describes and claims two embodiments (A and B) of an invention, A being disclosed in a French application and B in a German application, both filed within the preceding 12\u00a0months, the priority dates of both the French and German applications may be claimed for the appropriate parts of the European application; embodiment A will have the French priority date and embodiment B the German priority date as effective dates. If embodiments\u00a0A and B are claimed as alternatives in one claim, these alternatives will likewise have the different priority dates as effective dates.\nIf, on the other hand, a European application is based on one previous application disclosing a feature C and a second previous application disclosing a feature D, neither disclosing the combination of C and D, a claim to that combination will be entitled only to the date of filing of the European application itself. In other words, it is not permitted to \"mosaic\" priority documents. An exception might arise where one priority document contains a reference to the other and explicitly states that features from the two documents can be combined in a particular manner.\nAccording to G\u00a01/15, entitlement to partial priority may not be refused for a claim encompassing alternative subject-matter by virtue of one or more generic expressions or otherwise (generic \"OR\" claim) provided that said alternative subject-matter has been disclosed for the first time, directly, or at least implicitly, unambiguously and in an enabling manner in the priority document. No other substantive conditions or limitations apply in this respect.\nIn assessing whether subject-matter within a generic \"OR\" claim may enjoy partial priority, the first step is to determine the subject-matter disclosed in the priority document that is relevant, i.e. relevant in respect of prior art disclosed in the priority interval. This is to be done in accordance with the disclosure test laid down in the conclusion of G\u00a02/98 and on the basis of explanations put forward by the applicant or patent proprietor to support the claim to priority, in order to show what the skilled person would have been able to derive from the priority document. The next step is to examine whether this subject-matter is encompassed by the claim of the application or patent claiming said priority. If the answer is yes, the claim is de facto conceptually divided into two parts, the first corresponding to the invention disclosed directly and unambiguously in the priority document, the second being the remaining part of the subsequent generic \"OR\" claim not enjoying this priority but itself giving rise to a right to priority as laid down in Art.\u00a088(3).\nFor example, if the priority document discloses the use of a specific composition whereas the application claims the use of a composition defined in more generic terms, two alternative groups of subject-matters are identified as being encompassed by the claim, even if the claim does not expressly spell them out: \n\u2013\u00a0alternative (a), concerning the use of a specific composition (e.g. calcium salt of the active ingredient and tribasic phosphate salt in which the cation was multivalent) and\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0alternative (b), concerning the use of a composition defined in more generic terms (e.g. acid form or acceptable salt thereof as the active, inorganic salt in which the cation was multivalent, wherein active ingredient and inorganic salt were other than calcium salt of the acid and tribasic phosphate salt in combination).\u00a0\nAlternative (a) is the subject-matter disclosed in the priority document, not defined as such in the claim but encompassed by it. Alternative (b) is the remaining subject-matter of the claim, which was not disclosed in the priority document. In such a situation, the subject-matter of alternative (a) enjoys priority whereas that of alternative (b) does not.\nThe rationale of decision G\u00a01/15 also applies in the context of deciding whether an application from which priority is claimed is the first application within the meaning of Art.\u00a087(1). Just as a priority application and a patent claiming priority from it may partially relate to the same invention, the priority application and an earlier application filed by the same applicant may also partially relate to the same invention. In that case, the priority application would be the first application in respect of only that part of the invention which is not the same as in the earlier application (T\u00a0282/12).\nPartial priority may also be transferable separately (T\u00a0969/14). This, however, has consequences for the remaining priority right because the assignor is left with a limited right and may no longer keep claiming that partial priority (an applicant can only claim a right which they own). The transfer agreement of the partial priority gives a respective partial priority right to the assignor and the assignee corresponding to two clearly distinct and precisely defined alternatives.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part F \u2013 The European Patent Application", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Priority", "title": "2.

For example, the discovery that a particular known material is able to withstand mechanical shock would not be patentable, but a railway sleeper made from that material could well be patentable. To find a previously unrecognised substance occurring in nature is also mere discovery and therefore unpatentable. However, if a substance found in nature can be shown to produce a technical effect, it may be patentable. An example of such a case is that of a substance occurring in nature which is found to have an antibiotic effect.

However, they are excluded from patentability under Art.\u00a052(2)(a) when claimed as such (Art.\u00a052(3)).\nThe exclusion applies if a claim is directed to a purely abstract mathematical method and the claim does not require any technical means. For instance, a method for performing a Fast Fourier Transform on abstract data which does not specify the use of any technical means is a mathematical method as such. A purely abstract mathematical object or concept, e.g.\u00a0a particular type of geometric object or of graph with nodes and edges, is not a method but is nevertheless not an invention within the meaning of Art.\u00a052(1) because it lacks a technical character.\nIf a claim is directed either to a method involving the use of technical means (e.g.\u00a0a computer) or to a device, its subject-matter has a technical character as a whole and is thus not excluded from patentability under Art.\u00a052(2) and (3).\nMerely specifying the technical nature of the data or parameters of the mathematical method may not be sufficient on its own to define an invention within the meaning of Art.\u00a052(1). Even if the resulting method would not be considered a purely abstract mathematical method as such within the meaning of Art.\u00a052(2)(a) and (3), it may still fall under the excluded category of methods for performing mental acts as such if no use of technical means is implied (Art.\u00a052(2)(c) and (3); see G\u2011II,\u00a03.5.1).\nOnce it is established that the claimed subject-matter as a whole is not excluded from patentability under Art.\u00a052(2) and (3) and is thus an invention within the meaning of Art.\u00a052(1), it is examined in respect of the other requirements of patentability, in particular novelty and inventive step (G\u2011I,\u00a01).\nFor the assessment of inventive step, all features which contribute to the technical character of the invention must be taken into account (G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4). When the claimed invention is based on a mathematical method, it is assessed whether the mathematical method contributes to the technical character of the invention.\nA mathematical method may contribute to the technical character of an invention, i.e.\u00a0contribute to producing a technical effect that serves a technical purpose, by its application to a field of technology and/or by being adapted to a specific technical implementation (T\u00a02330/13). The criteria for assessing these two situations are explained below.\nTechnical applications\nWhen assessing the contribution made by a mathematical method to the technical character of an invention, it must be taken into account whether the method, in the context of the invention, produces a technical effect serving a technical purpose.\nExamples of technical contributions of a mathematical method are:\n\u2013\u00a0controlling a specific technical system or process, e.g.\u00a0an X-ray apparatus or a steel cooling process;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0determining from measurements a required number of passes of a compaction machine to achieve a desired material density;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0digital audio, image or video enhancement or analysis, e.g.\u00a0de-noising, detecting persons in a digital image, estimating the quality of a transmitted digital audio signal;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0separation of sources in speech signals; speech recognition, e.g.\u00a0mapping a speech input to a text output;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0encoding data for reliable and/or efficient transmission or storage (and corresponding decoding), e.g.\u00a0error-correction coding of data for transmission over a noisy channel, compression of audio, image, video or sensor data;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0encrypting/decrypting or signing electronic communications; generating keys in an RSA cryptographic system;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0optimising load distribution in a computer network;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0determining the energy expenditure of a subject by processing data obtained from physiological sensors; deriving the body temperature of a subject from data obtained from an ear temperature detector;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0providing a genotype estimate based on an analysis of DNA samples, as well as providing a confidence interval for this estimate so as to quantify its reliability;\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0providing a medical diagnosis by an automated system processing physiological measurements.\u00a0\nA generic purpose such as \"controlling a technical system\" is not sufficient to confer a technical character to the mathematical method. The technical purpose must be a specific one.\nFurthermore, the mere fact that a mathematical method may serve a technical purpose is not sufficient, either. The claim is to be functionally limited to the technical purpose, either explicitly or implicitly. This can be achieved by establishing a sufficient link between the technical purpose and the mathematical method steps, for example, by specifying how the input and the output of the sequence of mathematical steps relate to the technical purpose so that the mathematical method is causally linked to a technical effect.\nDefining the nature of the data input to a mathematical method does not necessarily imply that the mathematical method contributes to the technical character of the invention (T\u00a02035/11, T\u00a01029/06, T\u00a01161/04).\nIf steps of a mathematical method are used to derive or predict the physical state of an existing real object from measurements of physical properties, as in the case of indirect measurements, those steps make a technical contribution regardless of what use is made of the results.\nTechnical implementations\nA mathematical method may also contribute to the technical character of the invention independently of any technical application when the claim is directed to a specific technical implementation of the mathematical method and the mathematical method is particularly adapted for that implementation in that its design is motivated by technical considerations of the internal functioning of the computer system or network (T\u00a01358/09, G\u00a01/19). This may happen if the mathematical method is designed to exploit particular technical properties of the technical system on which it is implemented to bring about a technical effect such as efficient use of computer storage capacity or network bandwidth. For instance, the adaptation of a polynomial reduction algorithm to exploit wordsize shifts matched to the word size of the computer hardware is based on such technical considerations and can contribute to producing the technical effect of an efficient hardware implementation of said algorithm. Another example is assigning the execution of data-intensive training steps of a machine-learning algorithm to a graphical processing unit (GPU) and preparatory steps to a standard central processing unit (CPU) to take advantage of the parallel architecture of the computing platform. The claim should be directed to the implementation of the steps on the GPU and CPU for this mathematical method to contribute to the technical character.\nComputational efficiency\nIf the mathematical method does not serve a technical purpose and the claimed technical implementation does not go beyond a generic technical implementation, the mathematical method does not contribute to the technical character of the invention. In such a case, it is not sufficient that the mathematical method is algorithmically more efficient than prior-art mathematical methods to establish a technical effect (see also G\u2011II,\u00a03.6).\nHowever, if it is established that the mathematical method produces a technical effect due to having been applied to a field of technology and/or adapted to a specific technical implementation, the computational efficiency of the steps affecting that established technical effect is to be taken into account when assessing inventive step. See\u00a0G\u2011II,\u00a03.6.4 for examples where an improvement in computational efficiency qualifies as a technical effect.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.3.1 Artificial intelligence and machine learning\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.3.2 Simulation, design or modelling\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.4 Aesthetic creations\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a052": "Subject-matter relating to aesthetic creations will usually have both technical aspects, e.g.\u00a0a \"substrate\" such as a canvas or a cloth, and aesthetic aspects, the appreciation of which is essentially subjective, e.g.\u00a0the form of the image on the canvas or the pattern on the cloth. If technical aspects are present in such an aesthetic creation, it is not an aesthetic creation \"as such\" and it is not excluded from patentability.\nA feature which might not reveal a technical aspect when taken by itself could have a technical character if it brings about a technical effect. For example, the pattern of a tyre tread may actually be a further technical feature of the tyre if, for example, it provides improved channelling of water. On the contrary, this would not be the case when a particular colour of the sidewall of the tyre serves only an aesthetic purpose.\nThe aesthetic effect itself is not patentable, neither in a product nor in a process claim.\nFor example, features relating solely to the aesthetic or artistic effect of the information content of a book, or to its layout or letter font, would not be considered as technical features. Nor would features such as the aesthetic effect of the subject of a painting or the arrangement of its colours or its artistic (e.g.\u00a0Impressionist) style be technical. Nevertheless, if an aesthetic effect is obtained by a technical structure or other technical means, although the aesthetic effect itself is not of a technical character, the means of obtaining it may be. For example, a fabric may be provided with an attractive appearance by means of a layered structure not previously used for this purpose, in which case a fabric incorporating such structure might be patentable.\nSimilarly, a book defined by a technical feature of the binding or pasting of the back is not excluded from patentability under Art.\u00a052(2) and Art.\u00a052(3), even though it has an aesthetic effect too. A painting defined by the kind of cloth, or by the dyes or binders used, is likewise not excluded.\nA technical process, even if it is used to produce an aesthetic creation (such as a cut diamond), is nevertheless a technical process which is not excluded from patentability. Similarly, a printing technique for a book resulting in a particular layout with aesthetic effect is not excluded, and nor is the book as a product of that process. Again, a substance or composition defined by technical features serving to produce a special effect with regard to scent or flavour, e.g.\u00a0to maintain a scent or flavour for a prolonged period or to accentuate it, is not excluded.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.5 Schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.5.1 Schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a052": "The exclusion from patentability of schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts under Art.\u00a052(2)(c) concerns instructions to the human mind on how to conduct cognitive, conceptual or intellectual processes, for instance how to learn a language. The exclusion applies only when such schemes, rules and methods are claimed as such (Art.\u00a052(3)).\nIf a method claim encompasses a purely mental realisation of all method steps, it falls under the category of methods for performing mental acts as such (Art.\u00a052(2)(c) and (3)). This applies regardless of whether the claim encompasses also technical embodiments and of whether the method is based on technical considerations (T\u00a0914/02, T\u00a0471/05, G\u00a03/08).\nAn example is a claim defining a method for designing an arrangement for loading nuclear reactor fuel bundles into a reactor core in order to maximise the amount of energy that is generated before the reactor fuel needs to be refreshed. The method involves determining optimal values for specific technical parameters of the arrangement by starting with initial values, performing simulations based on these values, and iteratively changing the values based on simulation results until a stopping criterion is met. Such a method is based on technical considerations related to the technical field of nuclear reactors. However, as long as the claim does not exclude that all method steps may be carried out mentally, the claimed subject-matter is excluded from patentability. This objection also applies when the simulation involves real world values obtained by a technical measurement, if the claim does not include either a step of carrying out the technical measurement or a step of receiving the measured real world values using technical means.\nIn general, the complexity of a method cannot disqualify it as a method for performing mental acts as such. If technical means (e.g.\u00a0a computer) are necessary to carry out the method, they are included in the claim as an essential feature (Art.\u00a084, F\u2011IV,\u00a04.5). See also G\u2011II,\u00a03.3 for aspects related to algorithmic efficiency.\nA claimed method is not a method for performing mental acts as such if it requires the use of technical means (e.g.\u00a0a computer, a measuring device, etc.) to carry out at least one of its steps or if it provides a physical entity as the resulting product (e.g.\u00a0if it is a method of manufacturing a product comprising steps of designing the product and a step of manufacturing the product so designed).\nOnce it is established that the claimed method as a whole is not excluded from patentability under Art.\u00a052(2) and (3), it is examined in respect of the other requirements of patentability, in particular novelty and inventive step (G\u2011I,\u00a01).\nWhere a claim defining a method for performing mental acts as such is limited by specifying that the method is carried out by a computer, not only the use of a computer but also the steps carried out by the computer themselves may make a technical contribution if they then contribute to a technical effect. The presence of technical considerations, such as those related to the technical field of nuclear reactors in the example above, is not in itself sufficient to acknowledge the presence of a technical effect (G\u00a01/19).\nA method comprising steps which involve the use of technical means may also specify steps which are to be carried out mentally by the user of the method. These mental steps contribute to the technical character of the method only if, in the context of the invention, they contribute to producing a technical effect serving a technical purpose.\nFor example, a method may specify steps which result in the selection of a product among a family of products based on various criteria, as well as a step of manufacturing the selected product. If said selection steps are carried out mentally, they contribute to the technical character of the method only to the extent that a technical effect can be derived from the features characterising the sub-family of selected products over the generic family of suitable products (T\u00a0619/02). If the selection steps rely on purely aesthetic criteria, they result in a non-technical selection and thus do not contribute to the technical character of the method. As another example, in a method of affixing a driver to a Coriolis mass flowmeter, steps specifying how to select the position of the driver so as to maximise the performance of the flowmeter make a technical contribution to the extent that they define that particular position (T\u00a01063/05).\nFor additional information about methods of simulation, design and modelling, see G\u2011II,\u00a03.3.2.

The exclusion applies to rules for traditional games such as card or board games, as well as to game rules that underlie contemporary forms of gameplay such as in gambling machines or video games.\nGame rules define a conceptual framework of conventions and conditions that govern player conduct and how a game evolves in response to decisions and actions by the players. They comprise the setup of the game, options that arise as gameplay unfolds, as well as goals defining progress in the game. They are normally perceived (or even agreed to) by the players as rules serving the explicit purpose of playing the game. Game rules are hence of an abstract, purely mental nature and are meaningful only in the gaming context (T\u00a0336/07). For example, a condition requiring two randomly drawn numbers to match for winning is a game rule.\nContemporary games, and in particular video games, are often characterised by complex interactive and narrative elements of a virtual game world. Such game elements govern how the game proceeds of its own accord (e.g.\u00a0evolving characters and storylines) as well as how it proceeds in interaction with the player(s) (e.g.\u00a0tapping along with the game soundtrack to make your character dance if rhythms match). Given that these elements are conceptual in nature, they qualify, in a wider sense, as rules for playing games according to Art.\u00a052(2)(c) (T\u00a012/08). This holds true irrespective of the fact that they might be untold or revealed only while playing.\nIf the claimed subject-matter specifies technical means for implementing game rules, it has a technical character. For example, when implementing the aforementioned condition of matching random numbers, the use of a computer calculating a pseudo-random sequence or of mechanical means such as cubic dice or uniformly sectored reels is sufficient to overcome an objection under Art.\u00a052(2)(c) and (3).\nInventive step of a claim comprising a mix of game rules and technical features is examined in accordance with the problem-solution approach for mixed-type inventions as set out under G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4. As a principle, inventive step cannot be established by the game rules themselves, irrespective of how original they may be, or by their mere automation. It must rather be based on further technical effects of a technical implementation of the game, i.e.\u00a0technical effects that go beyond those already inherent to the rules. For example, a networked implementation of a game of chance like bingo, in which numbers physically drawn by an operator undergo a random mapping prior to transmission to remote players, makes a technical contribution since the scrambling of results has the technical effect of securing a data transmission, analogous to encryption, while having no bearing on the actual playing of the game. In contrast, a reduction of memory, network, or computational resources achieved by limiting the complexity of a game does not overcome a technical constraint by a technical solution. Rather than solving the technical problem of improving the efficiency of an implementation, such a limitation would at best circumvent it (G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4.1). Similarly, the commercial success of a game product resulting from simplified rules is an incidental effect without a direct technical cause.\nInventive step of an implementation is to be assessed from the point of view of the skilled person, typically an engineer or a game programmer, who is tasked with implementing game rules as set by a game designer. Mere claim drafting exercises such as paraphrasing non-technical game elements (\"win computation means\" for monitoring the number of game tokens) or abstracting them (\"objects\" instead of \"game tokens\") using terms that are technical only on the surface have no bearing on inventive step.\nGame rules often are designed to entertain and keep the interest of players by way of psychological effects such as amusement, suspense, or surprise. Such effects do not qualify as technical effects. Similarly, giving rise to a balanced, fair or otherwise rewarding gameplay are psychological effects, not technical ones. Hence, rules and corresponding computations which determine a game score or a skill rating for players, even if computationally complex, are usually considered non-technical.\nHighly interactive gameplay such as in video games involves technical means for sensing user input, updating the game state and outputting visual, audio or haptic information. Features defining such presentations of information and user interfaces are assessed according to G\u2011II,\u00a03.7 and 3.7.1. Cognitive content that informs the player about the current game state at a non-technical level, e.g.\u00a0about a game score, the arrangement and suits of playing cards, the state and attributes of a game character is regarded as non-technical information. This equally holds for instructions presented on game boards or cards such as \"go back to square one\". An example of a technical context in which the manner of presenting information can make a technical contribution is the interactive control of real-time manoeuvres in a game world, the display of which is subject to conflicting technical requirements (T\u00a0928/03).\nAside from rules, the state of a game world may also evolve in accordance with numerical data and equations that model physical principles or pseudo-physical behaviour, especially in video games. The systematic calculation of updates to such game states amounts to a computer-implemented simulation based on these models (G\u00a01/19). For the purpose of assessing inventive step in this context, the models are to be understood as defining a given constraint for a corresponding implementation on a computer (G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4). In contrast to effects that reside within the virtual game world or are otherwise inherent to the model already, a specific implementation of a simulation, if adapted to the internal functioning of a computer system, produces a technical effect. For instance, merely predicting the virtual trajectory of a billiard ball shot by the player, even if highly accurate, fails to solve a technical problem beyond its implementation. In contrast, adjusting the step sizes used in the distributed simulation of bullets fired in a multi-player online game based on current network latencies produces a technical effect.\nFeatures which specify how to provide user input normally make a technical contribution (G\u2011II,\u00a03.7.1). However, a mapping of parameters obtained from known input mechanisms to parameters of a computer game qualifies as a game rule in a wider sense if it reflects the choice of the game designer, set for the purpose of defining the game or making it more interesting or challenging (e.g.\u00a0a condition specifying that a slide gesture on a touchscreen determines both the power and the spin of a virtual golf shot).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.5.3 Schemes, rules and methods for doing business\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a052": "Subject-matter or activities which are of a financial, commercial, administrative or organisational nature fall within the scope of schemes, rules and methods for doing business, which are as such excluded from patentability under Art.\u00a052(2)(c) and (3).

Terms like \"system\" or \"means\" are to be looked at carefully, because a \"system\" might e.g.\u00a0refer to a financial organisation and \"means\" to organisational units if it cannot be inferred from the context that these terms refer exclusively to technical entities (T\u00a0154/04).\nOnce it is established that the claimed subject-matter as a whole is not excluded from patentability under Art.\u00a052(2) and (3), it is examined with respect to novelty and inventive step (G\u2011I,\u00a01). The examination of inventive step requires an assessment of which features contribute to the technical character of the invention (G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4).\nWhere the claim specifies a technical implementation of a business method, the features which contribute to the technical character of the claim are in most cases limited to those specifying the particular technical implementation.\nFeatures which are the result of technical implementation choices and not part of the business method contribute to the technical character and thus have to be duly taken into account. This is illustrated with the following example: The claim defines a computerised networked system which allows customers to obtain audio-visual content about selected products using computers installed at each sales outlet of a company, all connected to a central server with a central database storing the audio-visual content as electronic files. The distribution of the electronic files from the central server to the sales outlets could be technically implemented either by enabling download of individual files directly from the central database to the computer on request of a customer or, alternatively, by transferring a plurality of selected electronic files to each sales outlet, storing these files in a local database of the sales outlet and retrieving the corresponding file from the local database when audio-visual content is requested by a customer at the sales outlet. Choosing one implementation among these two options lies within the competence of a technically skilled person, such as a software engineer, as opposed to, for example, specifying that the set of audio-visual contents offered is different for each sales outlet, which would typically be within the competence of a business expert. Features of the claim specifying any of these two possible technical implementations contribute to the technical character of the invention, whereas features specifying the business method do not.\nIn the case of claims directed to a technical implementation of a business method, a modification to the underlying business method aimed at circumventing a technical problem, rather than addressing this problem in an inherently technical way, is not considered to make a technical contribution over the prior art. In the context of an automation of a business method, effects which are inherent in the business method do not qualify as technical effects (G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4.1).\nFor instance, an automated accounting method that avoids redundant bookkeeping may be considered to require fewer computer resources in terms of computer workload and storage requirements. These advantages, in so far as they result from a reduction of the number of operations to be performed and the amount of data to be considered due to the business specification of the accounting method, are inherent to the accounting method itself and hence do not qualify as technical effects.\nAnother example is based on an electronic auction that is performed by successively lowering the price until the price is fixed by the remote participant who first transmits a message. Since messages may be received out of order due to possible transmission delays, each message contains timestamp information. Changing the auction rules to obviate the need for timestamp information amounts to circumventing the technical problem of transmission delays rather than solving it with technical means (T\u00a0258/03). As a further example, in a method for carrying out electronic financial transactions with credit cards at a point of sale, the administrative decision to dispense with the need to obtain the name or address of the buyer to authorise the transaction may result in saving time and reducing data traffic. However, this measure, on its own, is not a technical solution to the technical problem of the bandwidth bottleneck of communication lines and the limited capacity of server computers, but an administrative measure which does not contribute to the technical character of the claimed subject-matter.\nThe mere fact that the input to a business method is real-world data is not sufficient for the business method to contribute to the technical character of the claimed subject-matter, even if the data relate to physical parameters (e.g.\u00a0geographic distances between sales outlets) (T\u00a0154/04, T\u00a01147/05, T\u00a01029/06). See also G\u2011II,\u00a03.3.\nIn a computer-implemented method for facilitating managerial decision-making, automatically selecting from a set of business plans the most cost-effective one which also enables meeting certain technical constraints (e.g.\u00a0to achieve a targeted reduction in environmental impact) is not considered to make a technical contribution beyond the computer-implementation.\nThe mere possibility of serving a technical purpose is not enough for a method to contribute to the technical character of the invention. For example, a claim to a \"method of resource allocation in an industrial process\" encompasses pure business processes and services in finance, administration, or management, without limiting the method to any specific technical process due to the breadth of meaning of the term \"industry\".\nThe result of a business method may be useful, practical or saleable but that does not qualify as a technical effect.\nBusiness method features, e.g.\u00a0administrative features, can be found in different contexts. For example, a medical support system may be configured to deliver information to the clinician on the basis of data obtained from patient sensors, and only if such data is not available, on the basis of data provided by the patient. The prioritisation of the sensor data over the data provided by the patient is an administrative rule. Establishing it lies within the competence of an administrator, e.g.\u00a0the head of the clinic, rather than within that of an engineer. As an administrative rule with no technical effect, it does not contribute to the technical character of the claimed subject-matter and may be used in the formulation of the objective technical problem as a constraint that has to be met when assessing inventive step (G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4). For further examples of applying the problem-solution approach to assess inventive step for subject-matter comprising business-method features, see G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4.2.1-G-VII,\u00a05.4.2.3.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.6 Programs for computers\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a052": "Computer programs are excluded from patentability under Art.\u00a052(2)(c) and (3) if claimed as such. However, following the generally applicable criteria for Art.\u00a052(2) and (3) (G\u2011II,\u00a02), the exclusion does not apply to computer programs having a technical character.\nIn order to have a technical character, and thus not be excluded from patentability, a computer program must produce a \"further technical effect\" when run on a computer. A \"further technical effect\" is a technical effect going beyond the \"normal\" physical interactions between the program (software) and the computer (hardware) on which it is run. The normal physical effects of the execution of a program, e.g.\u00a0the circulation of electrical currents in the computer, are not in themselves sufficient to confer technical character to a computer program (T\u00a01173/97 and G\u00a03/08).\nExamples of further technical effects which confer technical character to a computer program are the control of a technical process or of the internal functioning of the computer itself or its interfaces (see G\u2011II,\u00a03.6.1).\nThe presence of a further technical effect is assessed without reference to the prior art. It follows that the mere fact that a computer program serving a non-technical purpose requires less computing time than a prior-art program serving the same non-technical purpose does not on its own establish the presence of a further technical effect (T\u00a01370/11). Likewise, comparing a computer program with how a human being would perform the same task is not a suitable basis for assessing if the computer program has a technical character (T\u00a01358/09).\nIf a further technical effect of the computer program has already been established, the computational efficiency of an algorithm affecting the established technical effect contributes to the technical character of the invention and thus to inventive step (e.g. where the design of the algorithm is motivated by technical considerations of the internal functioning of the computer; see also G\u2011II,\u00a03.3).\nA computer program cannot derive a technical character from the mere fact that it has been designed such that it can be automatically performed by a computer. \"Further technical considerations\", typically related to the technical considerations of the internal functioning of the computer, going beyond merely finding a computer algorithm to perform a task are needed. They have to be reflected in claimed features that cause a further technical effect (G\u00a03/08).\nIf a claim is directed to a computer program which does not have a technical character, it is objected to under Art.\u00a052(2)(c) and (3). If it passes the test for having technical character, the examiner then proceeds to the questions of novelty and inventive step (see G\u2011VI and G\u2011VII, in particular G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4).\nComputer-implemented inventions\n\"Computer-implemented invention\" is an expression intended to cover claims which involve computers, computer networks or other programmable apparatus wherein at least one feature is realised by means of a computer program. Claims directed to computer-implemented inventions may take the forms described in F\u2011IV,\u00a03.9 and subsections.\nA computer program and a corresponding computer-implemented method are distinct from each other. The former refers to a sequence of computer-executable instructions specifying a method while the latter refers to a method being actually performed on a computer.\nClaims directed to a computer-implemented method, a computer-readable storage medium or a device cannot be objected to under Art.\u00a052(2) and (3) as any method involving the use of technical means (e.g.\u00a0a computer) and any technical means itself (e.g.\u00a0a computer or a computer-readable storage medium) have technical character and thus represent inventions within the meaning of Art.\u00a052(1) (T\u00a0258/03, T\u00a0424/03, G\u00a03/08).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.6.1 Examples of further technical effects\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.6.2 Information modelling, activity of programming and programming languages\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.6.3 Data retrieval, formats and structures\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.6.4 Database management systems and information retrieval\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.7 Presentations of information\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a052": "Presentations of information within the meaning of Art.\u00a052(2)(d) are understood as the conveying of information to a user. It concerns both the cognitive content of the information presented and the manner of its presentation (T\u00a01143/06, T\u00a01741/08). It is not limited to visual information, but also covers other presentation modalities, e.g.\u00a0audio or haptic information. However, it does not extend to the technical means used for generating such presentations of information.\nFurthermore, conveying information to a user is to be distinguished from technical representations of information directed to a technical system which will process, store or transmit that information. Features of data encoding schemes, data structures and electronic communication protocols which represent functional data as opposed to cognitive data are not regarded as presentations of information within the meaning of Art.\u00a052(2)(d) (T\u00a01194/97).\nWhen assessing exclusion from patentability under Art.\u00a052(2) and (3), the claimed subject-matter has to be considered as a whole (G\u2011II,\u00a02). In particular, a claim directed to or specifying the use of any technical means for presenting information (e.g.\u00a0a computer display) has, as a whole, technical character and is thus not excluded from patentability. As another example, a claim directed to a kit comprising a product (e.g.\u00a0a bleaching composition) and further features such as instructions for use of the product or reference information for evaluating the results obtained, wherein said further features have no technical effect on the product, is not excluded since the claim has a technical feature: a product comprising a composition of matter.\nOnce it is established that the claimed subject-matter as a whole is not excluded from patentability under Art.\u00a052(2) and Art.\u00a052 (3), it is examined in respect of the other requirements of patentability, in particular novelty and inventive step (G\u2011I,\u00a01).\nDuring the assessment of inventive step, features related to the presentation of information are analysed to determine if, in the context of the invention, they contribute to producing a technical effect serving a technical purpose. If not, they make no technical contribution and cannot support the presence of an inventive step (G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4). To determine whether a technical effect is produced, the examiner assesses the context of the invention, the task the user carries out and the actual purpose served by the particular presentation of information.\nA feature defining a presentation of information produces a technical effect if it credibly assists the user in performing a technical task by means of a continued and/or guided human-machine interaction process (T\u00a0336/14 and T\u00a01802/13). Such a technical effect is considered credibly achieved if the assistance to the user in performing the technical task is objectively, reliably and causally linked to the feature. This would not be the case if the alleged effect depends on subjective interests or preferences of the user. For example, for some users it is easier to understand data when it is displayed as numerical values, whereas others might prefer a colour-coded display. The choice of the one or other manner of displaying the data is thus not considered to have a technical effect (T\u00a01567/05). Similarly, whether or not it is easier to understand audio information conveyed as a musical scale instead of spoken words is a matter concerned only with the cognitive abilities of the user. As another example, allowing the user to set parameters determining the information to be presented or to select the manner of its presentation does not make a technical contribution if it merely accommodates subjective user preferences.\nDetermining the extent to which a particular presentation of information may be considered to credibly support the user in performing a technical task may be difficult. It may be simplified during the assessment of inventive step by comparing the invention with the prior art, thus allowing the analysis to be limited to the distinguishing features (G\u2011VII,\u00a05.4, paragraph\u00a05). This comparison may reveal that the potential support for the performance of the technical task is already achieved in the prior art, with the consequence that the distinguishing features make no technical contribution (e.g.\u00a0relate only to non-technical subjective user preferences).\nA feature relating to the presentation of information may commonly be considered to specify:\n(i)the cognitive content of the information presented, i.e.\u00a0defining \"what\" is presented; or\u00a0\n(ii)the manner in which the information is presented, i.e.\u00a0defining \"how\" the information is presented.\u00a0\nThis categorisation is adopted to allow for a more detailed discussion of technical effects in the rest of this section. It is noted that these categories are not meant to be exhaustive. Also, there are cases in which a feature falls into both categories. For example, a step of \"displaying the surname of a customer in capital letters\" in a claimed method defines both the cognitive content of the presented information (surname of a customer) and the manner of its presentation (in capital letters). Such a feature may be considered to consist in fact of two features: the displayed text is the surname of a customer (falling into the first category) and the displayed text is shown in capital letters (falling into the second category). The manner of presentation itself might additionally convey cognitive information. For example, the capitalised part of a name may, as a matter of convention, indicate which part is the surname.\n(1)\u00a0What (which information) is presented?\u00a0\nIf the cognitive content of the information presented to the user relates to an internal state prevailing in a technical system and enables the user to properly operate this technical system, it has a technical effect. An internal state prevailing in a technical system is an operating mode, a technical condition or an event which is related to the internal functioning of the system, may dynamically change and is automatically detected. Its presentation typically prompts the user to interact with the system, for example to avoid technical malfunctions (T\u00a0528/07).\nStatic or predetermined information about technical properties or potential states of a machine, specifications of a device or operating instructions do not qualify as an internal state prevailing in the device. If the presentation of static or predetermined information merely has the effect of helping the user with the non-technical tasks preceding the technical task, it does not make a technical contribution. For example, the effect that the user is not required to know or memorise a sequence of buttons to be operated prior to configuring a device is not a technical effect.\nNon-technical information such as the state of a casino game, a business process or an abstract simulation model is exclusively aimed at the user for subjective evaluation or non-technical decision-making. It is not directly linked to a technical task. Therefore, such information does not qualify as an internal state prevailing in a technical system.\n(2)\u00a0How is the information presented?\u00a0\nA feature in this category typically specifies the form or arrangement in which, or the timing at which, information is conveyed to the user (e.g.\u00a0on a screen). One example is a diagram designed solely for conveying information. Specific technical features related to, for example, the way audio signals or images are generated are not regarded as a manner in which information is presented.\nFeatures defining a visualisation of information in a particular diagram or layout are normally not considered to make a technical contribution, even if the diagram or layout arguably conveys information in a way which a viewer may intuitively regard as particularly appealing, lucid or logical.\nFor instance, dealing with limited available screen space is part of designing presentations of information for human viewing and therefore not an indication of technicality per se. The general idea of giving an overview of a plurality of images in a limited display area by displaying a single image and sequentially replacing it with other images is not based on technical considerations, but is a matter of layout design. Similarly, arranging objects within available screen space by eliminating \"white space\" between window panes follows the same layout principles as would apply to the layout of a magazine cover and does not involve technical considerations.\nOn the other hand, if the manner of presentation credibly assists the user in performing a technical task by means of a continued and/or guided human-machine interaction process, it produces a technical effect (T\u00a01143/06, T\u00a01741/08, T\u00a01802/13). For example, displaying several images side by side in low resolution and allowing selection and display of an image at higher resolution conveys information to the user in the form of a technical tool that enables the user to perform the technical task of interactively searching and retrieving stored images more efficiently. Storing digital images at different resolutions gives rise to the technical effect of allowing the simultaneous overview display of several images (T\u00a0643/00). As another example, in a video soccer game, the particular manner of conveying to the user the location of the nearest teammate by dynamically displaying a guide mark on the edge of the screen when the teammate is off-screen produces the technical effect of facilitating a continued human-machine interaction by resolving conflicting technical requirements: displaying an enlarged portion of an image and maintaining an overview of a zone of interest which is larger than the display area (T\u00a0928/03). As a further example, in the context of a visual aid for a surgeon, if, in the course of surgery, the current orientation of a medical ball joint implant is displayed in a manner which credibly assists the surgeon to correct the position of the implant in a more precise manner, this is considered to provide a technical effect.\nEffects relying on human physiology\nWhen a manner of presenting information produces in the mind of the user an effect which does not depend on psychological or other subjective factors but on physical parameters which are based on human physiology and can be precisely defined, that effect may qualify as a technical effect. The manner of presenting information then makes a technical contribution to the extent that it contributes to this technical effect. For example, displaying a notification on one of a plurality of computer screens near the user's current visual focus of attention has the technical effect that it is more or less guaranteed to be seen immediately (compared e.g.\u00a0with an arbitrary placement on one of the screens). In contrast, the decision to show only urgent notifications (compared e.g. to all notifications) is based only on psychological factors and thus makes no technical contribution. Minimising information overload and distraction is not considered to qualify per se as a technical effect (T\u00a0862/10). As another example, displaying a stream of images in which the parameters for delay and change in the content between successive images are computed on the basis of physical properties of human visual perception in order to achieve a smooth transition is considered to make a technical contribution (T\u00a0509/07).\nIf information (e.g.\u00a0a visual or audio stimulus) is presented to a person for the purpose of producing in that person a physiological reaction (e.g.\u00a0involuntary eye gaze) which can be measured in the context of assessing a medical condition (e.g.\u00a0eyesight, hearing impairment or brain damage), that presentation of information may be considered to produce a technical effect.\nEffects relying on mental activities of the user\nWhere the claimed subject-matter comprises a feature of presenting information to a user, be it of category (i) or (ii), an evaluation by the user is involved. Although such an evaluation per se is a mental act (Art.\u00a052(2)(c)), the mere fact that mental activities are involved does not necessarily qualify subject-matter as non-technical. For example, in T\u00a0643/00 discussed above, the user makes an evaluation based on an overview of low-resolution images in order to locate and objectively recognise a desired image. This mental evaluation may be considered to be an intermediate step steering the image search and retrieval process and thus forms an integral part of a solution to a technical problem. Such a solution relies neither on facilitating the human tasks of understanding, learning, reading or memorising nor on influencing the user's decision as to which image is to be searched. It provides a mechanism for inputting a selection which would not be possible if the images were not displayed in that specific arrangement.\nOn the other hand, if the choice or layout of information presented aims exclusively at the human mind, in particular to help the user to take a non-technical decision (e.g.\u00a0which product to buy based on a diagram showing properties of products), no technical contribution is made.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "3.7.1 User interfaces\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "4.

Antipersonnel mines are an obvious example. Examples in the area of biotechnological inventions as laid down in Rule\u00a028 are listed in G\u2011II,\u00a05.3. G\u00a01/03 explains that practical examples under Art.\u00a053(a) arise from the fact that not everything can be done to human beings that can be done to other living beings. For example, the avoidance of offspring that are unwanted because of certain properties (sex, colour, health) and for economic reasons may be quite legitimate for domestic animals but when applied to human beings it would be contrary to \"ordre public\" or morality.\nThis provision is likely to be invoked only in rare and extreme cases. A fair test to apply is to consider whether it is probable that the public in general would regard the invention as so abhorrent that the grant of patent rights would be inconceivable. If it is clear that this is the case, an objection is raised under Art.\u00a053(a); otherwise not.

The manufacture of prostheses or artificial limbs could be patentable. For instance, a method of manufacturing insoles in order to correct the posture or a method of manufacturing an artificial limb is patentable. In both cases, taking the imprint of the footplate or a moulding of the stump on which an artificial limb is fitted is clearly not of a surgical nature.

A cosmetic treatment involving surgery or therapy would, however, not be patentable (see\u00a0below).\nTo be excluded from patentability, a treatment or diagnostic method must actually be carried out on the living human or animal body (G\u00a01/04). A treatment of or diagnostic method practised on a dead human or animal body would therefore not be excluded from patentability by virtue of Art.\u00a053(c). Treatment of body tissues or fluids after they have been removed from the human or animal body, or diagnostic methods applied thereon, are not excluded from patentability as long as these tissues or fluids are not returned to the same body. Thus the treatment of blood for storage in a blood bank or diagnostic testing of blood samples is not excluded, whereas a treatment of blood by dialysis with the blood being returned to the same body would be excluded.\nRegarding methods which are carried out on or in relation to the living human or animal body, it must be borne in mind that the intention of Art.\u00a053(c) is only to free from restraint non-commercial and non-industrial medical and veterinary activities. Interpretation of the provision must avoid the exceptions from going beyond their proper limits (see G\u00a05/83, G\u00a01/04, and G\u00a01/07).\nWhether or not a method is excluded from patentability under Art.\u00a053(c) cannot depend on the person carrying it out (see\u00a0G\u00a01/04 and G\u00a01/07, Reasons\u00a03.4.1).\nHowever, in contrast to the subject-matter referred to in Art.\u00a052(2) and Art.\u00a052(3) which is only excluded from patentability if claimed as such, a method claim is not allowable under Art.\u00a053(c) if it includes at least one feature defining a physical activity or action that constitutes a method step for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy. In that case, whether or not the claim includes or consists of features directed to a technical operation performed on a technical object is legally irrelevant to the application of Art.\u00a053(c) (see\u00a0G\u00a01/07, Reasons\u00a03.2.5).\nClaims to medical devices, computer programs and storage media which comprise subject-matter corresponding to that of a method for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy or to that of a diagnostic method practised on the human or animal body are not to be objected to under Art.\u00a053(c), because only method claims may fall under the exception of Art.\u00a053(c).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "4.2.1.1 Surgery\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "4.2.1.2 Therapy\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "4.2.1.3 Diagnostic methods\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "4.2.2 Methods for screening potential medicaments and clinical trials\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a053": "Although in general a medical claim directed to tests carried out on \"animals\" must exclude from its scope the use of human beings as \"test animals\" (e.g.\u00a0by means of a disclaimer), in some infrequent cases, a claim may, in the light of the description, be interpreted as exclusively relating to a clinical trial of an experimental medicament carried out on human beings.

This is the case even if technical means are provided serving to enable or assist the performance of the essentially biological steps. In contrast, plants or animals produced by a technical process which modifies the genetic characteristics of the plant or animal are patentable.\nThe term exclusively is used here to mean that a plant or animal originating from a technical process or characterised by a technical intervention in the genome is not covered by the exclusion from patentability even if in addition a non-technical method (crossing and selection) is applied in its production.\nDetermining whether a plant or animal is obtained by exclusively biological means entails examining whether there is a change in a heritable characteristic of the claimed organism which is the result of a technical process exceeding mere crossing and selection, i.e.\u00a0not merely serving to enable or assist the performance of the essentially biological process steps.\nThus transgenic plants and technically induced mutants are patentable, while the products of conventional breeding are not.\nBoth targeted mutation, e.g.\u00a0with CRISPR/Cas, and random mutagenesis such as UV-induced mutation are such technical processes. When looking at the offspring of transgenic organisms or mutants, if the mutation or transgene is present in said offspring it is not produced exclusively by an essentially biological method and is thus patentable.\nFurthermore, for living matter to be patentable, it must be possible to reproduce it in a way that has exactly the same technical features. Reproducibility can be assured for example:\n(1)\u00a0By a deposit of the living matter (seeds, microbiological strains). The deposited material must be publicly available and such that the invention can actually be reproduced starting from it. If, for example, a novel and inventive trait is due to a single transgene, a skilled person can reproduce the invention from a living sample. If, instead, the claimed trait is dependent on a large number of structurally undefined loci in the genome, these will segregate in subsequent generations and it will be an undue burden to reproduce the invention from the deposited sample (T\u00a01957/14).\n(2)\u00a0By disclosing in the application as filed the gene sequence responsible for the claimed trait together with instructions on how to reproducibly introduce by technical means such an altered sequence in a target organism (e.g. by CRISPR-Cas).\u00a0\nIf a technical feature of a claimed plant or animal, e.g.\u00a0a single nucleotide exchange in the genome, might be the result of either a technical intervention (e.g.\u00a0directed mutagenesis) or an essentially biological process (a natural allele), a disclaimer is necessary to delimit the claimed subject-matter to the technically produced product in order to comply with the requirements of Art.\u00a053(b) and Rule\u00a028(2). Otherwise the subject-matter is directed to excluded subject-matter and is to be refused on the basis of Art.\u00a053(b) in conjunction with Rule\u00a028(2). A disclaimer is required in all cases and, in particular, even if the description only mentions a technical method of production and is silent on the use of an essentially biological process. If, on the other hand, the feature in question can unambiguously be obtained by technical intervention only, e.g.\u00a0a transgene, no disclaimer is necessary.\nThis should apply also if such a disclaimer relates to subject-matter that was not disclosed in the application as filed. In such a case the disclaimer fulfils the requirements laid down in G\u00a01/03, G\u00a02/03 and G\u00a01/16 because it is introduced to exclude subject-matter not eligible for patent protection (for the general principles governing disclaimers see also H\u2011V,\u00a04).\nSuch a disclaimer will only be necessary for patent applications with a filing date and/or a priority date after 1\u00a0July\u00a02017. A disclaimer will not be required for patents granted before that date or for pending patent applications with a filing date and/or a priority date before 1\u00a0July\u00a02017 (see G\u00a03/19, OJ\u00a0EPO 2020,\u00a0A119).\nThe technicality of a claimed plant or animal product may lie in a non-heritable physical feature imparted directly to the claimed organism, e.g.\u00a0a seed coated with a beneficial chemical.\nThe technical method of production of the plant or animal may be included in the claims, in the form of product-by-process claims (see F\u2011IV,\u00a04.12).\nPlant products that are not propagation material, such as flour, sugars or fatty acids, have to be considered on the basis of their chemical properties only. Thus provided the general patentability requirements are fulfilled, it will not be relevant whether the subject-matter (e.g.\u00a0a sugar molecule) is isolated from a product (e.g.\u00a0a living plant) of an essentially biological process or is produced in a laboratory.\nExamples are provided below under G\u2011II,\u00a05.4.2.1.\nThis exclusion regarding plants and animals exclusively obtained by means of an essentially biological process does not apply to patents granted before 1\u00a0July\u00a02017 or to pending patent applications with a filing date and/or a priority date before 1\u00a0July\u00a02017 (see G\u00a03/19, OJ\u00a0EPO 2020,\u00a0A119).\nFor these applications and these granted patents, the exclusion from patentability of essentially biological processes for the production of plants does not have a negative effect on the allowability of a product claim directed to plants or plant material such as seeds or other plant propagation material. This applies even if the only method available at the filing date for generating the claimed plants or plant material is an essentially biological process for the production of plants, and also if the claimed product is defined in terms of such a process (product-by-process claim, see F\u2011IV,\u00a04.12). In this context it is of no relevance that the protection conferred by the product claim encompasses the generation of the claimed product by means of an essentially biological process for the production of plants (see G\u00a02/12 and G\u00a02/13). The same principle applies mutatis mutandis with regard to animals produced by means of essentially biological processes (see also F\u2011IV,\u00a04.12).\nFor patent applications with a filing date and/or a priority date on or after 1\u00a0July\u00a02017, if the technical characteristics of a claimed plant or animal are due to a technical step, the description must not contain any references to essentially biological methods (such as screening wild populations or conventional breeding) as an alternative method to obtain the claimed plant or animal. If such references are made, they must be deleted because they are not commensurate with the scope of the claim. Adapting the description is necessary \u2013 in addition to the disclaimer in the claims \u2013 to bring it into line with the claims (see F\u2011IV,\u00a04.3) but there is no need for an additional disclaimer in the description. In contrast, any mention of essentially biological processes to multiply or transfer a feature obtained with technical means, e.g. mutagenesis, may remain in the description, even though they cannot be claimed.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "5.4.1 Plant varieties\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Rule\u00a026": "The term \"plant variety\" is defined in Rule\u00a026(4).

However, in such cases the claims must not, explicitly or implicitly, include the sexual crossing and selection process.\nProcesses for selecting plants or animals using genetic molecular markers without crossing the plants or animals are not excluded from patentability. Technical means, such as genetic molecular markers, used in such processes are not excluded, either.\nA process for producing triploid seedless melon fruit which involves the pollination of sterile female flowers of a triploid plant, unable to carry out successful meiosis, with pollen of the diploid polliniser plant and which therefore does not concern sexually crossing two whole genomes of plants (implying meiosis and fertilisation) and the subsequent selection of plants is not an essentially biological process and is hence not excluded from patentability (T\u00a01729/06).\nA process of treating a plant or animal to improve its properties or yield or to promote or suppress its growth, e.g.\u00a0a method of pruning a tree, would not be an essentially biological process for the production of plants or animals since it is not based on the sexual crossing of whole genomes and subsequent selection of plants or animals; the same applies to a method of treating a plant characterised by the application of a growth-stimulating substance or radiation. The treatment of soil by technical means to suppress or promote the growth of plants is also not excluded from patentability (see also G\u2011II,\u00a04.2.1).\nClaims to breeding methods leaving out an explicit reference to either a crossing or selection step, but where such a step is an essential feature, lack clarity and support (Art.\u00a084).\nThe abbreviation NBT stands for \"new breeding techniques\". This is not a technical term, but a general one which is used for a variety of methods, some clearly technical but others either comprising or consisting of essentially biological processes. Therefore it is not suitable to differentiate whether claimed subject-matter is allowable under Art.\u00a053(b) and has no relevance in terms of patentability.\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "5.4.2.1 Examples\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "5.5 Microbiological processes\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter II \u2013 Inventions", "title": "5.5.1 General remarks\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a053": "As expressly stated in Art.\u00a053(b), second half-sentence, the exception referred to in the first half-sentence does not apply to microbiological processes or the products thereof.\n\"Microbiological process\" means any process involving or performed upon or\u00a0resulting in microbiological material.

The term \"microorganism\" includes bacteria and other generally unicellular organisms with dimensions beneath the limits of vision which can be propagated and manipulated in a laboratory (see\u00a0T\u00a0356/93), including plasmids and viruses and unicellular fungi (including yeasts), algae, protozoa and, moreover, human, animal and plant cells.

The width of this definition is to be noted. There are no restrictions whatever as to the geographical location where or the language or manner in which the relevant information was made available to the public; also no age limit is stipulated for the documents or other sources of the information.

For instance, German utility models (\"Gebrauchsmuster\") are already publicly available as of their date of entry in the Register of utility models (\"Eintragungstag\"), which precedes the date of announcement in the Patent Bulletin (\"Bekanntmachung im Patentblatt\"). The search report also cites documents in which doubts with regard to the fact of public availability (for \"in-house state of the art\", see\u00a0F\u2011II,\u00a04.3) and doubts concerning the precise date of publication (see\u00a0B\u2011VI,\u00a05.6 and G\u2011IV,\u00a07.5) of a document have not, or not fully, been removed (see\u00a0B\u2011VI,\u00a05.6 and G\u2011IV,\u00a07.5).\nIf the applicant contests the public availability or assumed date of publication of the cited document, the examiner needs to consider whether to investigate the matter further.

By the \"content\" of a European application is meant the whole disclosure, i.e.\u00a0the description, drawings and claims, including:\n(i)any matter explicitly disclaimed (with the exception of disclaimers for unworkable embodiments);\u00a0\n(ii)any matter for which an allowable reference (see\u00a0F\u2011III,\u00a08, penultimate paragraph) to other documents is made; and\n(iii)prior art in so far as explicitly described.\u00a0\nHowever, the \"content\" does not include any priority document (the purpose of such document being merely to determine to what extent the priority date is valid for the disclosure of the European application (see\u00a0F\u2011VI,\u00a01.2)) nor, in view of Art.\u00a085, the abstract (see\u00a0F\u2011II,\u00a02).\nIt is important to note that it is the content of the earlier application as filed which is to be considered when applying Art.\u00a054(3). Where an application is filed in a non-official language as permitted by Art.\u00a014(2) (see\u00a0A\u2011VII,\u00a01.1), it may happen that matter is erroneously omitted from the translation in the language of the proceedings and not published under Art.\u00a093 in that language. Even in this case, it is the content of the original text which is relevant for the purposes of Art.\u00a054(3).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter IV \u2013 State of the art", "title": "5.1.1 Requirements\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter IV \u2013 State of the art", "title": "5.1.2 Accorded date of filing and content of the application still subject to review\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter IV \u2013 State of the art", "title": "5.2 Euro-PCT applications\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a0153": "The above principles also apply to PCT applications designating EP, but with an important difference.

Regarding use claims of the above type, it is also to be noted that a mere pharmaceutical effect does not necessarily imply a therapeutic application. For instance, the selective occupation of a specific receptor by a given substance cannot be considered in itself as a therapeutic application; indeed, the discovery that a substance selectively binds a receptor, even if representing an important piece of scientific knowledge, still needs to find an application in the form of a defined, real treatment of a pathological condition in order to make a technical contribution to the art and to be considered as an invention eligible for patent protection (see\u00a0T\u00a0241/95). See also F\u2011IV,\u00a04.22 for the functional definition of a pathological condition.\nA claim in the format of a Swiss-type claim is a purpose-related process claim, whereas a claim drafted in accordance with Art.\u00a054(5) is a purpose-related product claim. Therefore, such claims have different categories. This has the following consequences:\n(i)If a parent application has been granted with a Swiss-type claim, granting a patent on the basis of the purpose-related product claim in its divisional application would not lead to double patenting (T\u00a013/14; see also G\u2011IV,\u00a05.4).\n(ii)Since a claim to a particular physical activity (e.g.\u00a0method, process, use) confers less protection than a claim to the physical entity per se (G\u00a02/88, Reasons\u00a05.1), a Swiss-type claim confers less protection than a claim formulated according to Art.\u00a054(5). Therefore a change from a Swiss-type claim to a claim drafted in accordance with Art.\u00a054(5) contravenes Art.\u00a0123(3) (T\u00a01673/11; see also H\u2011IV,\u00a03.4).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Novelty", "title": "6.1.1 -   - 7.1.1\u00a0 - Products that may be claimed for a further medical use ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Novelty", "title": "6.1.2 -   - 7.1.2\u00a0 - Therapeutic uses pursuant to  - Art.\u00a054(5) -  ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Novelty", "title": "6.1.3 -   - 7.1.3\u00a0 - Diagnostic uses pursuant to  - Art.\u00a054(5) -  ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Novelty", "title": "6.1.4 -   - 7.1.4\u00a0 - Surgical uses pursuant to  - Art.\u00a054(5) -  ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Novelty", "title": "6.1.5 -   - 7.1.5\u00a0 - Dependent claims pursuant to  - Art.\u00a054(5) -  ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Novelty", "title": "6.2 -   - 7.2\u00a0 - Second non-medical use ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Novelty", "title": "7. -   - 8.\u00a0 - Selection inventions ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Novelty", "title": "7.1 -   - 8.1\u00a0 - Error margins in numerical values ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VI \u2013 Novelty", "title": "8. -   - 9.\u00a0 - Novelty of \"reach-through\" claims ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VII \u2013 Inventive step", "title": "Chapter VII \u2013 Inventive step", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part G \u2013 Patentability", "chapter": "Chapter VII \u2013 Inventive step", "title": "1.

That is the responsibility of the applicant or proprietor.\nThe examining or opposition division must check that the separate claims do not contravene Art.\u00a0123(2) and Art.\u00a0123(3), and that they meet the other requirements of the EPC. The same applies to a separate description (see\u00a0H\u2011III,\u00a04.1).\nMoreover, in general, there is no justification for a separate description. However, at a suitable point in the preamble to the description, preferably in a separate paragraph following the information pursuant to Rule\u00a042(1)(a), a reference to this situation must be made, for example along the following lines:\n\"With reference to ... (e.g.\u00a0earlier application No. ... in ...), the applicant has voluntarily limited the scope of the application /patent for... (contracting state) by submitting separate claims for this (these) state(s).\"\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part H \u2013 Amendments and Corrections", "chapter": "Chapter III \u2013 Admissibility of amendments \u2013 other procedural matters", "title": "4.5 Opposition proceedings where the claims as granted are different for different contracting states\u00a0 ", "implementation": {}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part H \u2013 Amendments and Corrections", "chapter": "Chapter III \u2013 Admissibility of amendments \u2013 other procedural matters", "title": "5.

The only basis for the method is the examples. The board observed that for some solutions the amount of added rosin was extremely low whereas for others it was extremely high. The subject-matter of the amended claim was considered to be an unallowable generalisation of the examples, since nothing in the description indicated to the person skilled in the art that the observed variations were not essential to make a coating composition (T\u00a0200/04).\nExample 4\nOriginal claim\u00a01 relates to a multi-processing system comprising a shared memory, a directory and a serialisation point. The serialisation point is defined in functional terms. Claim\u00a01 was amended by adding features that were addressed in the description as part of the cache coherence strategy. The board held that the incorporated features, albeit disclosed as such, had been isolated in an arbitrary manner from the overall disclosure of the cache coherent memory access architecture. At least one feature had been omitted although its function was presented as being essential to achieving cache coherence. Therefore amended claim\u00a01 was not directly and unambiguously derivable from the original application (T\u00a0166/04).\n"}}, {"book": "EPO_guidelines", "part": "Part H \u2013 Amendments and Corrections", "chapter": "Chapter V \u2013 Allowability of amendments \u2013 examples", "title": "3.3 Deletion of part of the claimed subject-matter\u00a0 ", "implementation": {"Article\u00a0123": "It is permissible to delete parts of the claimed subject-matter if the corresponding embodiments were originally described, e.g.\u00a0as alternatives in the claim or as embodiments explicitly set out in the description. \nExample:\nOriginal application: \u00a0\n\n\"A polymer blend XY ... containing, as a filler, graphite, talc, asbestos or silica\"\n\n\nPrior art:\u00a0\n\n\"A polymer blend XY ... containing asbestos\".\n\n\nLimited claim:\u00a0\n\n\"A polymer blend XY ... containing, as a filler, graphite, talc or silica\".\n\n\nThe deletion of alternatives from more than one list is only allowable if this does not result in the creation of new technical information that is not directly and unambiguously derivable from the application as originally filed.\nIn particular, limitations that do not result in the singling out of a particular combination of specific features but maintain the remaining subject-matter as a generic group which differs from the original group only by its smaller size will normally fulfil the requirements of Art.\u00a0123(2) EPC.\nDeletion of part of the claimed subject-matter resulting in a combination of specific features may be allowable if the application as filed provides a pointer towards that particular combination, e.g. by reference to particular embodiments.\nThese principles also apply to the combination of features resulting from dependent claims.\nExample\nOriginal claim 1 \u00a0\n\n\"A composition for therapeutic use comprising a therapeutic agent and a glass-forming carbohydrate.\"\n\n\nOriginal claim 22\u00a0\n\n\"A composition according to claim 1 wherein the therapeutic agent is selected from the group enzymes, biopharmaceuticals, growth hormones, growth factors, insulin, monoclonal antibodies, interferons, interleukins and cytokines.\"\n\n\nOriginal disclosure\u00a0\n\nIn the description, inhalation is listed as one of several ways of administration.\nIn the description, insulin is listed as one of several therapeutic agents.\n\n\nLimited claim 1\u00a0\n\n\"A composition for therapeutic use suitable for administration by inhalation comprising a therapeutic agent and a glass-forming carbohydrate\".\n\n\nDependent claim 10\u00a0\n\n\"A composition according to claim 1 wherein the therapeutic agent is insulin\"\n\n\nThe limitation to inhalation in claim\u00a01 results from a choice from one list and has a basis in the application as originally filed.\nThe combination of the subject-matter of dependent claim\u00a010 with the subject-matter of claim\u00a01 results from a selection from multiple lists which is not disclosed directly and unambiguously in the application as originally filed.\nThe number of amendments held to have been combined to arrive at the amended claimed subject-matter is not decisive in order to assess whether the claimed subject-matter extends beyond the content of the application as filed.
