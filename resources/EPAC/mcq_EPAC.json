We are of the opinion that with enough training and time to \nprepare for the exam a candidate should be able to correctly answer at least 8 of the 15 questions. \n \nThis year, 55% of candidates passed the first part of the exam, and 60% of those candidates also \npassed the second part, meaning that in total, 35% of the candidates enrolled passed the EPIC \n2022 exam.",

        "global_explanation": "Statement A is not correct because Rule 56 does not apply to missing claims (the application was filed in \n2021, i.e. before the entry into force of the new Rule 56a EPC). \nStatement B is correct (Rule 56(3) EPC). \nStatement C is not correct because it is not possible to amend the claims before search (Rule 137(1) EPC). \nStatement D is not a good solution because the date of a priority claim would precede the date of filing of \nthe European patent application by more than twelve months. \n \nLegal basis \n\n \n \n6\n  \nRule 56(1) EPC \nIf the examination under Article 90, paragraph 1, reveals that parts of the description, or drawings \nreferred to in the description or in the claims, appear to be missing, the European Patent Office \nshall invite the applicant to file the missing parts within two months. \n \n \nRule 56(3) EPC \nIf the missing parts of the description or missing drawings are filed […] and the application claims priority of \nan earlier application, the date of filing shall, provided that the missing parts of the description or the \nmissing drawings are completely contained in the earlier application, remain the date on which the \nrequirements laid down in Rule 40, paragraph 1, were fulfilled, where the applicant so requests and files, \n[…].  \n  \n   \nRule 137(1) EPC \nBefore receiving the European search report, the applicant may not amend the description, claims or \ndrawings of a European patent application unless otherwise provided. \n \n  \n  \n \n \n\n \n \n7\nPart 2 \nNote: the legal basis and the information in parenthesis were not needed to get full marks. \n \nQuestion 1 \n \n(a) The application EP-F3 to be transferred has to be pending at the time of transfer \n(see steps under (b)).  \nFile a request for a transfer of rights (EPO Form 5050 can be used) and submit \nwritten evidence suitable for proving the transfer (with the signature of both the \nassignor and assignee). Pay the transfer fee.  \n \n(b) The filing in Italian is valid only if the previous applications were also filed in Italian. \nRequest further processing by paying the fee for further processing (50% of the \nrelevant fees) by 14 December 2022 and pay the search fee, filing fee (without \nreduction) according to Rule 6(4) EPC including page fee (for eight pages) and \nadditional fee for divisional second generation. \n \n(c) After the transfer of rights (at the latest by the time of payment of the reduced \nexamination fee) the representative of the joint applicants should send a letter to the \nEPO stating that both applicants A and C are entities or natural persons covered by \nRule 6(4) EPC (Form 1011 can be used).  \nRequest examination in Italian, a translation of the request for examination in the \nlanguage of the proceedings must be refiled (Guidelines A-X, 9.2.3). \n \n \nQuestion 2 \n \n(a) The request for restoration had to be filed within two months of the date on which \nthe priority period expired, which is 26 July 2021. \n(The priority period expired on 22 May 2021 extended to 24 May 2021.  \n24 May 2021 + 2 months => 24 July 2021, extended to 26 July 2021). \n \n(b) (The restoration granted by the USPTO as receiving Office will not automatically be \neffective before the EPO because the EPO is not bound by the decision of any \nreceiving Office under the \"unintentional criterion\".)  \nTo ensure that priority is restored during the European phase, the applicant should \nrequest restoration of priority within one month of the date on which the time limit for \nentry into EPO regional phase expires (Article 22 PCT) \n(Rule 49ter.2(b)(i) PCT; Rule 159(1)) EPC sets a 31-month deadline) \n22.05.2020 + 31 months = 22.12.2022  \n22.12.2022 + 1 month = 22.01.2023 (Sunday) extended to 23.01.2023 \n(Monday).  \n \n\n \n \n8\nThe fee for restoration of priority must be paid within the same time limit \n(Rule 49ter.2(b)(iii), (d) PCT).  \nThe request for restoration of priority must be accompanied by a statement of reasons \nfor the failure, despite meeting the due-care requirement, to file the international \napplication within the priority period (Rule 49ter.2(b)(ii) PCT). \n \nQuestion 3 \n \n(a) Confirm to the receiving Office (International Bureau) that the drawings of the \npriority application are included in the international patent application through \nincorporation by reference (Rule 20(6) PCT). \nSend a copy of these drawings to the receiving Office (International Bureau) \ntogether with the confirmation.  \nWithin two months of the original filing date  \n5 December 2022 + 2 months => 5 February 2023 (Sunday) => extended to \n6 February. \n \n(b) Same as (a) / (Confirm to the International Bureau that the drawings of the priority \napplication are included in the international patent application through incorporation \nby reference, send a copy of these drawings to the International Bureau together \nwith the confirmation).  \n \nRO/107 notification bears a two-month time limit, \n4 January 2023 + 2 months => 4 March 2023 (Saturday) => extended to 6 March \n2023 \n \n(c) The requirement for incorporation by reference is that the priority of the earlier \napplication must also have been claimed on filing (Rule 20(6) PCT). \nThus, no remedy is possible in this case. \n \n(d) Yes, you can withdraw the application and prevent publication before completion of \ntechnical preparations for the publication. \nPublication is due promptly after the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, \nwhich is after 20 June 2023 (in practice Thursday, 22 June). \nThe technical preparations for publication are completed by the 15th day prior to the \ndate of publication (see paragraph AG 9.014; in practice, withdrawal at the latest on \nTuesday, 6 June). \n \nQuestion 4 \n \n(a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by \n12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). \n\n \n \n9\nThe filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of \nabstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) \nEPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). \n \n(b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was \nduly replenished (point 8 AAD).  \nSince this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be \nwithdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). \nNo action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account \n(the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the \nfiling fee (which includes the page fee)).  \n \n(c) A translation must be filed within two months of the filing of the application \n12 Dec 2022 + 2 months = 12 Feb 2023 (Sun) = 13 Feb 2023; \nor within two months of notification of a communication under Rule 58 EPC.  \n \nIf documents to be filed by one of the means of electronic communication permitted \nby the President of the European Patent Office (under Rule 2(1) EPC) cannot be \nreceived on the day on which a period for performing procedural acts expires, the \nperiod shall extend to the first working day on which all means of electronic filing are \navailable (Rule 134(1) EPC and OJ EPO 2020, A120)."
