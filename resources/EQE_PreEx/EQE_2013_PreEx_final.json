The distinguishing feature over D4 (the air channel is a through-hole extending  from the first planar surface to the second planar surface and that the filter unit is  attached to cover an end of the through-hole) provides the technical effect that gas  can pass only through the filter plate and the air channel. Hence, the rate of  exchange of gasses through the stopper can be more precisely determined by the  diameter of the air channel and the gas permeability of the filter plate. In view of  this, a valid definition of the objective technical problem is how to make a stopper  for a bottle having a predictable gas permeability (see paragraphs [0007] and  [0008]). Another more general definition is how to make a stopper for a bottle that  allows to better predict the maturation of the wine (paragraph [0003]), last  sentence).  Statement 17.2 is not related to the claimed distinguishing feature. For statement  17.3 it is noted that D4 is already air permeable without using cork, i.e. permeability  in general is not the problem to be solved."

The application only discloses the specific synthetic rubber; \u201crubber\u201d includes also  the undisclosed natural rubber. In the wording \u201csuch as rubber\u201d a preferable  undisclosed embodiment is unallowably introduced.  The term \u201celement\u201d generalizes the form of the filter plate, which has no basis in  the application.  The deletion of the wording is allowable, since it is redundant with the direction of  the flow of air already defined in the last three lines of claim VII."
