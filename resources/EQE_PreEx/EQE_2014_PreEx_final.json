            "examiner_note": "The V-shaped well helps to collect the liquid soap into the well and the tube guided into the  well helps to extract as much amount of liquid soap as possible from the bottle, i.e. to  reduce the amount of liquid soap remaining in the bottle.  For statement 20.2, reference is made to paragraph [007] of the application which explicitly  mentions this technical effect.  Paragraph [007] of the application only states that \u201cnearly all the soap can be removed  from the bottle\u201d. The application does not teach a complete removal of the soap. The only  document providing the solution to this problem is D3, which teaches to wash out the  bottle with water.  For statement 20.4 it is noted that claim IV.4 is not limited to the type of soap and this  cannot serve as a basis for a valid argument for inventive step."
