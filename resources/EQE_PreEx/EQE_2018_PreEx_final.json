The national application FR-B can only be prior art under  Article 54(2) EPC and not under Article 54(3) EPC. Lack of novelty and lack of  sufficiency of disclosure are separate grounds for opposition, Article 100 EPC.  Moreover, the objection of lack of sufficiency of disclosure was raised after the  expiration of the opposition period (see G10/91 and Guidelines, D-V, 2.2).

An appeal against the decision to grant would be an appeal of a not adversely  affected party. The applicant can disagree to the text proposed, provided he  requests reasoned amendments (Rule 71(6) EPC). The examining division  may not resume the examination proceedings (cf. GL edition 2016 C-V, 4.7)   and consequently may not consider third party observations after the decision  to grant has been handed over to the EPO's internal postal service, Rule  71a(2) EPC, see also G12/91 and GL edition 2016 E-V, 3. In the present case  of statement 4.4, the applicant has already received the decision to grant and  therefore it is correct to answer \u201ctrue\u201d.

The time limit for entry into the European  phase expires on [29 July 2015 + 31 months =] 28 February 2018,  Rule 159(1) EPC and Rule 131(4) EPC). According to Rule 159(1)(c) EPC,  the filing fee must be paid on entry into the European phase. Hence, for  validly entering the European phase today, it is necessary to pay the filing fee.  In view of arguments raised on appeal it appears that the statement 5.3 could  be understood as referring to the concept of \u201centry\u201d versus \u201cearly entry\u201d into  the European phase with regard to 26 February 2018. This would additionally  require the lifting of the processing ban before the 31-month time limit has  expired by filing a request for early entry (cf. GL E-IX, 2.8 and OJ EPO 213,  156).
