The priority for claims 1 and 3 being valid, the effective date under  Article 89 EPC for these two claims is the filing date of IT-G.

It is not a  requirement of Rule 80 EPC that the amendments actually resolve issues raised in  the notice of opposition. Although clarity is not a ground for opposition, in the present  case the clarity of the amended claim can be discussed, since the amendment,  which was introduced during opposition proceedings, is based on the description  (G3/14). The patent proprietor is entitled to file amendments in reply to the  communication informing him of the notice of opposition. Since the patent proprietor       requests to maintain the patent in amended form (in accordance to Article 101(3)(a)  EPC), his request is not to reject the opposition (in accordance with Article 101(2)  EPC)."
