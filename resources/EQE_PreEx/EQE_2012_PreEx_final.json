The statement of 20.1, which is directed solely to the first embodiment  of D2 and does not acknowledge the second embodiment of D2, is not helpful to define  why it would not be obvious to provide the claimed features.  However, the statement 20.2  is relevant as it demonstrates that D2 teaches a different solution to that claimed in  Claim X. A valid argument is necessarily directed to the features recited in the independent  claim. The argument set out in20.3 is not directed to the characterising features of  Claim X and is therefore not a valid argument in support of inventive step being provided  by the claimed features.  However, the argument set out in20.4 is a valid argument in the  light of the claimed features."
