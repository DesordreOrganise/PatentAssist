When using any other type of solid wood, the thickness must be at least  10 cm, see [0014]. Hence, the thickness  is an essential feature of the invention. Since  claim A) claims a door leaf in a fire protection door comprising a solid wood plate having a  smaller thickness as required by the description, claim A) is not supported by the  description. Claim B) is directed to a door leaf per se, wherein a step of the door leaf is  defined such that it shall match with a step in a door frame which is however not part of the  claim. Many different sizes and forms of steps are possible, hence, the size or the form of  the door leaf step is not defined in claim B) but is dependent from another entity that is not  part of claim B), see also Guidelines F-IV, 4.14. Hence, claim B) is not clear and does not  fulfil the requirements of Article 84 EPC. Claim C) is directed to a fire protection door  comprising a door leaf that comprises a plate made of solid wood.

The  first and second embodiments each have a door closer 12, 23 that biases the door leaf  into the closed position, [0018]. Hence, the first and the second embodiments of the  application fall within the scope of claim I.7. In the first embodiment, the door closer 12 has  a mechanical spring 14 and a lever element 15. This falls under the scope of the second  alternative of claim I.8. The second embodiment has a door closer 23 including a cable 24  and a weight 25. This falls under the scope of the first alternative of claim I.8. Hence, both  the first and the second embodiments fall within the scope of claim I.8. The second  embodiment relates to a sliding door. The description of the general construction of a door  leaf in [0017] mentions a door step, but only in connection with a door leaf 1a for a pivoting  door while a stepped door leaf 1a is not suitable for sliding doors. According to the   description, the sliding door of the second embodiment cannot have a stepped door leaf.  The second embodiment does not fall within the scope of claim I.10."

No technical reason is given for the covering with  aluminium and it seems that this is only for design purposes. Further D3 relates to  emergency exit doors and gives no indication at all for a functionality for fire protection.  Thus, although D3 discloses a door covered by an aluminium layer, there is no teaching in  D3 that this could improve a fire protection function. D1 discloses a calcium silicate plate  wherein calcium silicate can release water when heated. The filling of D1 is a cardboard  containing calcium silicate, no alternatives are given. The statement 20.2 indicates that the  material of D2 should replace the material of D1. This is not a valid argument within the  framework of the problem solution approach, since D2 and not D1 is the closest prior art  document. Hence, the answer to 20.2 is \u201cFalse\u201d. The formulation of 20.2 was however  unnecessarily complex. Just by using the expression \u201cD2 could be replaced by\u201d instead of  \u201cD2 could replace\u201d the solution would become \u201cTrue\u201d, since there is no teaching that solid  wood could be replaced by the material of D1. For this reason, it is exceptionally decided  to award marks for the answer \u201cTrue\u201d as well. D1 discloses just a door leaf for a fire  protection door which is formed from two metal sheets that overlap at the side of the door  leaf. There is no teaching how a door frame could be constructed. Hence, although the  figure of D1 shows a small step on the side of the door leaf due to a overlap of metal  sheets, this step is only because two edge portions of the metal sheets overlap; there is no  teaching to combine a step in a door with a step in a door frame to come to a better sealed  door gap. D1 discloses in [0002] that the preferred metal is steel because of its high  melting point above 1300\u00b0C, and it is further mentioned that this has the advantage that  the metal of the door can withstand normal temperatures occurring during fire and  maintains its stiffness even at higher temperatures. This leads away from using aluminium  which melts away in the event of fire. Hence, D1 teaches away from using aluminium in  fire protection doors."
