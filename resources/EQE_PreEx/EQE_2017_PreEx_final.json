The priority for claims 1 and 3 being valid, the effective date under  Article 89 EPC for these two claims is the filing date of IT-G.

You have found the following two documents D1 and D2 during a prior art search on the internet:   Document D1 (published November 2013)    [001] While cleaning their teeth, adults, in particular, often press their toothbrushes too hard while cleaning their teeth. This excessive force can seriously irritate the gums of these users. It is an object of the present invention to make a user aware of such excessive force.    [002] The toothbrush of FIG. 1 comprises a bristle zone 11 with bristles 12, which is connected to a handle 13. The handle 13 comprises a controller 14, a battery 15, a green light-emitting diode (LED) 16 and a red LED 17. The brush head also contains a pressure sensor 18 in the bristle zone 11, right below the bristles. The controller 14 is connected with the battery 15, each of the LEDs 16 and 17, and the pressure sensor 18 by means of electric cables. A pressure limit value, which has been obtained by clinical research, is stored in the controller 14.    [003] The pressure sensor 18 generates an electric signal as long as the user presses the bristles against the teeth. That signal is transmitted to the controller 14, converted into a measured pressure and compared to the pressure limit value. As long as the measured pressure is below the pressure limit value, the controller 14 supplies electric energy to the green LED 16. The user is thereby informed that the brush does not harm the user's gums. However, if the measured pressure exceeds the pressure limit value, the controller 14 switches the energy supply to the red LED 17. The user is thereby alerted that the brush is pressed too hard.

The European Search Report established by the European Patent Office cites documents D3 and D4.    Document D3 (published November 2013)   [001] The present invention relates to toothbrushes for human adults. Toothbrushes are used in combination with toothpaste for removing dental plaque from teeth.    [002] It is an object of the present invention to provide toothbrushes which prevent that dental plaque remains on the teeth. The present invention is based on the surprising finding that the amount of dental plaque removal can be increased by transmitting additional vibrations to the bristles of the toothbrush. These vibrations are generated by an electric vibrator in the toothbrush. The location of the vibrator directly below the bristles is required for optimum transmission of the vibrations to the bristles.   [003] The toothbrush of FIG. 1 comprises a brush head with a bristle zone 31 and bristles 32, and a handle 33 with a controller 34, a battery 35 and a push button 36. An electric vibrator 37 is located in the bristle zone 31, right below the bristles. The controller 34 is connected with the battery 35, the push button 36 and the vibrator 37 by means of electric cables. Electric energy is supplied through an electric cable to the vibrator 37, as long as the controller 34 determines that the user's finger is pressing down the push button 36, and vibrations are generated and transmitted to the bristles. Thereby, the amount of dental plaque removal can be increased.    [004] The toothbrush according to FIG. 1 has a total length of 24 cm.",

The first embodiment of D4 therefore does not represent the most promising starting point, at least in view of the feature \u201clength of the toothbrush is between 18 and 25 cm.\u201d. The second embodiment of D4 only relates to scratching a human's back. That second embodiment therefore belongs to an entirely different technical field. Compared to D4, D2 or D3 are more promising starting points."
