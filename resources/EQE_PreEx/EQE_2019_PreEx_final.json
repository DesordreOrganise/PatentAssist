It is mentioned that this composite  structure (10) is stronger than a structure without a support grid. Since the stack of plies is  stronger, the plies of fibre-reinforced composite material are strengthened using a support  grid.  D11 just discloses a support grid in a composite structure but no reinforcing inserts. D12  just discloses reinforcing inserts but no support grid. There is no hint in D11 or D12 that a  reinforcing insert and a support grid could be joined together.   Although the range as claimed in A.2 falls within the range of D11, D11 does not disclose  the norm XYZ mesh size of the support grid (12) between 100 and 150. The selected sub- range is narrow compared to the known range, and sufficiently far removed from any  specific values disclosed in the prior art. Further, the selected range is not an arbitrary  specimen of the prior art but a purposive selection (see application, paragraph [007], see  also Guidelines, G-VI, 8 (ii) (a), (b) and (c)). Hence, the range of claim A.2 is novel over  either D11 and D12. Further, it provides the surprising effect of improving the fastening  strength considerably (paragraph [007]) and contributes, together with the features of  claim A.1, to a combined effect of further improving the strengthening. Thus, the range of  claim A.2 contributes to an inventive step. This feature would contribute to patentability  over a combination of D11 and D12 and provides a valid argument for novelty and  inventive step.      Due to the above arguments, the features of claims A.1 and A.2 taken together are not  only a juxtaposition of features but do have a combined technical effect"
