The PCT request indicates the EPOas International Searching Authority (ISA). The filing fee, search fee and transmittal fee havebeen duly paid.In a notification dated 17 January 2024, the SPTO invited applicant D to furnish a translation.",

                    "answer": "The SPTO accepts only Spanish as the language in which international applications may befiled, Rule 12.1(a) PCT and PCT Applicant\u2019s Guide Annex C. PCT-3 was filed in Spanish,because otherwise the SPTO would have transmitted it to the IB, Rule 19.4(a)(ii) and Rule19.4(b) PCT.The EPO, acting as ISA, Article 152 EPC, accepts English, French or German, PCT-EPOGuidelines A-VII, 2.1. Therefore, Spanish is not accepted. The invitation issued by the SPTOis thus an invitation under Rule 12.3(c) PCT to furnish a translation into one of English,French or German for the international search. The time limit for the late filing of thetranslation is the later of: - one month from the date of the invitation, i.e. 17 January 2024 + 1 month \u2192 17 February2024 (Sat) \u2192 19 February 2024 (Mon), Rule 80.5 PCT, and- two months from the date of receipt of the international application by the receiving Office,i.e. 05.03.2024 (Tue, today). Therefore, today, D needs to file the translation and pay the latefurnishing fee, Rule 12.3(e) PCT."

                    "answer": "According to Article 19(1) PCT, amended claims can only be filed after the receipt of theinternational search report and, according to Rule 46.1 PCT, within 2 months from the date ofits transmittal or within 16 months from the priority date, whichever expires later. Theamendments must be filed at the IB, Rule 46.2 PCT.Since the application is filed in Spanish, it will be published in Spanish, which is a languageof publication, Rule 48.3(a) PCT. Hence, the amendments must be filed in Spanish, Rule 46.3PCT.An obvious mistake in the description can be corrected under Rule 91.1(b)(ii) PCT. Since theapplication is translated under Rule 12.3(a) PCT, the rectified description needs to be filedboth in Spanish and in the language of translation, Rule 12.2(b)(i) PCT. This must be done atthe EPO/ISA within 26 months from the priority date, Rule 91.2 PCT."

            "examiner_note": "This question was generally well answered. Most candidates stated that PCT-3 was likely filed in Spanish, as it is an accepted language by the SPTO. Fewer candidates however realized that PCT-3 must have been filed in Spanish, as it is the only language accepted by the SPTO and would otherwise have been transmitted to the IB. Quite a few candidates missed the fact that late filing of the translation is possible or did not calculate the corresponding time limits. Most candidates correctly answered when and where to file amended claims and the rectified description. Some candidates however wrongly concluded that the claim amendments must be filed in the language of translation. Many candidates missed the fact that the rectified description needs to be filed both in the language of the application and in the language of translation. "

Since the search opinion was negative, a reply to the opinion also had to be filed by thesame date, Rule 70a(1) EPC.The communication noting the loss of rights is a communication under Rule 112(1) EPCindicating that the application is deemed to be withdrawn because three independentprocedural acts were omitted:- payment of the examination fee, Article 94(1) and (2) EPC;- payment of the designation fee, Rule 39(2) EPC;- non-compliance with the invitation to comment on the objections raised and/or to correctany deficiencies noted in the search opinion, Rule 70a(3) EPC.Further processing, Article 121 and Rule 135(1) EPC, was available for each of the omittedacts until 12 December 2023 + 2 months \u2192 12 February 2024 (Mon). Thus, today, it is toolate.Removal of the cause of non-compliance is today, i.e. when company C became aware of thenotification. Re-establishment into the period for further processing under Article 122(1) EPCis thus still possible until 05 March 2024 + 2 months \u2192 05 May 2024 (Sun) \u2192 06 May 2024(Mon), Rule 131(4) and Rule 134(1) EPC. This is within 1 year from the missed time limit forfurther processing, i.e. 12 February 2024 + 1 year \u2192 12 February 2025, Rule 136(1) EPC.The three omitted procedural acts have different legal bases and are therefore independentfrom each other. Consequently, three requests for re-establishment must be filed and three feesfor re-establishment must be paid, Guidelines E-VIII, 3.1.3.Company C must provide evidence that the failure to observe the time limit resulted from anisolated mistake within a normally satisfactory monitoring system, Guidelines E-VIII, 3.2,which shows that all due care was taken, Rule 136(2) EPC.Company C must further complete the omitted acts for re-establishment, i.e. request furtherprocessing, Article 121(1) EPC and Rule 135(1) EPC, by:- Paying the examination fee, and paying the fee for further processing, i.e. paying theexamination fee with a 50% surcharge, Article 2(1) item 12 RFees;- Paying the designation fee, and paying the fee for further processing, i.e. paying thedesignation fee with a 50% surcharge, Article 2(1) item 12 RFees;- Filing a reply to the search opinion and paying the fee for further processing, Article 2(1)item 12 RFees. The renewal fee for the third year was due on 30.11.2023, Rule 51(1) EPC.

Some candidates forgot that the designation fee also has to be paid. Many candidates failed to recognize that the application is deemed withdrawn independently for each of the three omitted acts and did not cite all relevant legal bases. Most candidates correctly indicated that further processing was available, but the time limit for it has been missed, so that re-establishment into the period for further processing is the only option. Points were frequently missed due to wrongly calculated time limits. In particular, candidates often did not start the calculation of the 1-year time limit of Rule 136(1) EPC from the missed time limit for further processing. Moreover, the list of acts to be performed was often incomplete or insufficient legal basis was cited. Many candidates forgot to mention renewal fees or did not conclude that renewal fees for the third year will become due on the date of the notification of the decision re-establishing the rights. "

The opposition fee was paid on that date. The notice was filed in Spanish by A and B, named in that order, and signed by both of them. It includes the opponents' particulars, correctly identifies the opposed patent EP-1 and contains a statement of the extent to which EP-1 is opposed and properly substantiated grounds for this.On 29 January 2024, the opposition division issued an invitation to remedy deficiencies, setting a time limit of two months.Yesterday B filed a translation of the notice of opposition in English.",

                    "answer": "The signature of A is invalid, because, in a joint opposition, each party or their duly authorized representative must sign the notice of opposition giving rise to their participation,Guidelines A-VIII, 1.4.Since A is not resident in a contracting state, A must appoint a professional representative forfiling the opposition, Article 133(2) EPC. The invitation of the opposition division is aninvitation under Rule 77(2) EPC to appoint a representative and to arrange for the signature orapproval of the notice of opposition by the representative to be appointed, Guidelines D-IV,1.2.2.2 (iv). This must be done until 29 January 2024 + 2 months \u2192 29 March 2024 (GoodFriday), Rule 134(1) EPC \u2192 02 April 2024 (Tue). The professional representative appointedby A shall be deemed to be the common representative upon appointment, Rule 151(1) EPC.Both A and B are persons according to Article 14(4) EPC, because both are nationals of Spainand additionally B is resident of Spain, which has Spanish as an official language. Hence, thejoint opponents could file the notice of opposition in Spanish, but a translation in an officiallanguage of the EPO had to be filed. The translation could be filed until the expiration of theopposition period, i.e. until yesterday, Rule 6(2) EPC. The translation was therefore filed ontime.However, since the letter accompanying the translation was not filed by the commonrepresentative, it will be considered not duly signed, Rule 50(3) EPC in combination withRule 86 EPC. The common representative, once appointed by A, will have to sign a letteraccompanying the translation on invitation of the EPO within a time limit to be specified.Once this is done, the translation will retain its original date, i.e. it will be considered to havebeen filed in due time."

Most candidates realized that A, not being a resident of a contracting state, needed to appoint a professional representative, and that the representative needed to sign the notice of opposition. Many candidates wrongly argued that the appointed representative will be deemed common representative only because A, who needs representation, is named first. Some candidates realized that the translation of the notice of opposition was timely filed before the expiration of the opposition period, albeit not being validly signed. However, many failed to recognize that, to retain its original date, the accompanying letter needs to be signed by the appointed representative. "

The EPO maydisregard evidence, which has not been submitted by the parties in due time, Article 114(2)EPC.In the present case:-EP-D2 will be admitted into the proceedings, because it is prima facie relevant to theassessment of novelty, Article 114(1) EPC, Guidelines E-VI, 2.1;-EP-D3 will not be admitted into the proceedings, because it is not related to the extentof the opposition, G9/91.Claim 1 of EP-4 lacks novelty in view of EP-D2, Article 100(a) EPC in conjunction withArticles 52(1) and 54(3) EPC. Therefore, company E should as soon as possible file a new(main) request with claims directed to subject-matters 1: A+B, 2: A+C and 3: D.The replacement of one independent claim as granted by two independent claims isadmissible as the replacement is occasioned by a ground for opposition, Guidelines H-II, 3.1.The thus amended claims are novel over EP-D2. The patent will therefore be maintained inamended form, Article 101(3)(a) EPC.The resulting patent will nevertheless not be valid. The claim directed to subject-matter Dlacks novelty over EP-D3 but cannot be deleted in opposition proceedings, because it is notpart of the extent of the opposition, G9/91.To obtain a valid patent, company E should file a request for limitation, Article 105a(1) EPC,after the opposition proceedings are terminated, Article 105a(2) EPC.

However, many candidates failed to recognize that EP-D3 is only relevant for claim 4, which is not covered by the extent of the opposition and will therefore not be admitted. Many candidates copied relevant provisions but failed to apply those to the situation at hand. Most candidates correctly suggested filing amended claims relating to subject-matters A+B and A+C. Many candidates did not realize that subject-matter D cannot remain in a valid patent.

Art. 6(6) of the Regulations on the European qualifying examination forprofessional representatives).General commentsCandidates are reminded that they should pay attention to the way questions are asked andshould not simply repeat information from the paper in the answer. Repeating information perse is not awarded any marks. Alternative answers, one being correct and one being wrong, forthe markers to choose from do not attract any marks.In part I, full marks are only awarded when the full legal basis is cited to support the analysis.Some candidates lost marks due to missing or incomplete legal basis. Citing only the legalbasis or repeating the text therefrom without any further explanation, reasoning or providingadvice generally does not attract any marks. Alternative relevant legal basis not mentioned inthe possible solution also attracted marks. It is noted in this respect that the onlineexamination with direct access to part of the syllabus in electronic form, appears to be seen asan invitation to copy articles, rules and paragraphs from the guidelines, for which full marksare only awarded if, apart from the copied text, the explanation is also provided in view of thesituation in the question. With respect to the abolished 10-day rule, most candidates followedthe Decision of the Supervisory Board of 26 June 2023 and calculated the time limitsaccording to the newest version of the rules. Nevertheless, candidates, who correctly appliedthe old version, were also awarded full marks this year."
