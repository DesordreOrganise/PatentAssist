Thus, EP-A1 is deemed withdrawn, Art. 94(4) EPC .  EP-A2 was filed before the loss of right i.e. while EP-A1 was pending in the sense of Rule 36(1) EPC, but it was not filed in the language prescribed by Rule 36(2) EPC. Therefore EP-A2 cannot be treated as a valid divisional application, J13/14.  A further divisional application EP-A3 of EP-A1 should be filed in English. EP-A3 should claim invention Y.    A divisional application can only be filed if the loss of rights of EP-A1 is remedied, Art. 121(3) in conjunction with Rule 36(1) EPC. A should thus request further processing, Art. 121 EPC in respect of EP-A1, i.e. pay the further processing fee and file an answer to the communication thereby reviving EP-A1.  The filing fee and search fee for EP-A3 have to be paid, Rule 36(3) EPC.  Renewal fees already due in respect of EP-A1 have to be paid for EP-A3, Art. 86(1) and Rule 51 (3) EPC."

For the subject-matter ALU, US-D is not the \u201cfirst application\u201d in the sense of Art. 87(1) EPC because EP-D0 is also from applicant D and discloses the subject-matter ALU. Therefore the claimed priority is not valid for the subject-matter ALU and the effective date of the subject-matter ALU is 8 June 2020. For the subject-matter NOTALU, US-D is the \u201cfirst application\u201d and thus the effective date of the subject-matter NOTALU is 7 June 2019. c-a) Then answer to a) would be Yes: In that case EP-D0 was published before the effective date of the subject-matter ALU but after the effective date of the subject-matter NOTALU. EP-D0 thus forms part of the prior art under Art. 54(2) EPC for the subject-matter ALU and under Art. 54(3) EPC for the subject-matter NOTALU. c-b) Then answer to b) would be No: - 8 -  Any amendment excluding ALU would violate Art. 123(2) EPC."

General comments  Candidates are reminded that they should pay attention to the way the questions are asked and should not simply repeat information from the paper in the answer. Repeating information per se is not awarded any marks. Alternative answers, one being correct and one being wrong, for the markers to choose from do not attract any marks.  In Part I, full marks were only awarded when the full legal basis was cited to support the analysis. Citing only the legal basis or repeating the text therefrom without any further explanation, reasoning or providing advice generally does not attract any marks. However, alternative relevant legal bases also attracted marks.  An unnecessary amount of points was sometimes lost due to miscalculation of time limits.  Candidates are reminded that the PCT questions may make up a substantial part of paper D. - 2 -"
