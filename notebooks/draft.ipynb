They are the  applicants for European patent application EP1, which has been filed today in  Portuguese together with a French translation. EP1 claims the priority of a previous  Brazilian application P1. Starting from the same conditions as outlined above in  Question 5 and assuming now Assuming now that Roberto and Mario intend to file a  divisional application EP1-DIV relating to the pending patent application EP1, indicate  whether the following statements are true or false.\n",

Some of the claims of EP-P-DIV2 contain subject-matter that  was not originally disclosed in EP-P.      For each of the statements 3.1 – 3.4, indicate on the answer sheet  whether the statement is true or false:\n",
      "1. EP-P-DIV1 was not validly filed as a divisional application of EP-P, because EP-P-DIV1 was filed before the publication of EP-P.\n",
