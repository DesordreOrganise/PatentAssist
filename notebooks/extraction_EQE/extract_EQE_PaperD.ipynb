      "context: Today is 8 March 2022. You receive the following e-mail from the firm Optimisme.Dear Representative,[001] My   name   is   Candide.   I   am   the   General   Manager   of   Italian   company Optimisme (OPT). OPT specialises in plastic recycling. We design our own recycling machines  in-house  and  we  have  them  made  by  Torre  (TOR),  an  Italian  company manufacturing plastic recycling machines. When we started working with TOR in 2018, we signed an agreement. Under this agreement, TOR is bound to secrecy, and all intellectual property generated since then belongs to OPT. In future, we will manufacture these machines ourselves.[002] A known process of recycling includes cutting the plastic waste into small pieces in a mill, i.e. in a container with blades rotating at its bottom. An inorganic filler in the form of a powder is fed to the mill to be mixed with the plastic pieces to increase rigidity of the plastic. The problem with this known machine is that the maximum amount of filler that can be fed to the mill is 10% by weight. If higher amounts are fed to the mill, part of the filler is ejected outside the machine and a lot of dust is generated. Conventionally, to reach 50% by weight of filler, the plastic exiting the mill must be processed with another machine, where more filler is mixed with the plastic.[003] In January 2019, we invented a new machine for recycling plastic. In our machine the filler is fed to the bottom of the mill so that it is mixed with the plastic pieces while the plastic waste is cut. This is a great improvement over the prior techniques: we can feed up to 50% of filler to the plastic in the mill and during the process less dust is generated, so that workers are safer than before.[004]  On 3  June 2019  we gave TOR our  complete technical drawings and a  fully enabling explanatory report to enable them to manufacture our machine, which we called FEED. On 1 July 2019 we received a prototype of the FEED machine with one feeding duct at the bottom of the mill. We modified the FEED machine received from TOR by adding a second feeding duct at the bottom of the mill. We discovered that by using two feeding ducts for the filler, a surprisingly greater uniformity of the recycled plastic  can  be  obtained.  We  filed  a  European  patent  application,  OPT-EP1,  on  22 July 2019. OPT-EP1 discloses and claims a machine comprising at least one duct for feeding filler at the bottom of the mill. OPT-EP1 also discloses the machine with two feeding ducts at the bottom of the mill. This feature is claimed in dependent claim 2.[005] After filing OPT-EP1, we realised that by mounting a special water spray device (SPRAY) on the FEED machine it is possible to reduce the dust generated by the machine,   surprisingly   without   affecting   the   properties   of   the   recycled   plastic. On 4 October 2019, we filed European patent application OPT-EP2 without claiming any priority. OPT-EP2 includes the entire description and claims of OPT-EP1; it additionally discloses the SPRAY device and the FEED machine with the SPRAY device mounted on it.[006]  On 30 September 2020, we filed international application OPT-PCT. OPT-PCT contains  the  entire  description  and  claims  of  OPT-EP2  and  additionally  claims  the SPRAY device per se, and the FEED machine with the SPRAY device mounted on it. OPT-PCT claims priority from OPT-EP2.[007] OPT-EP1   was   granted   as   filed.   The   mention   of   grant   was   published  on 27 January 2021. OPT-EP1 was opposed by a German lawyer. The grounds of opposition are lack of novelty and inventive step based on two documents.[008] The  first  document  is  TOR-EP,  a  European  patent  application  filed  by  TOR  on 3 June 2019. The figures in TOR-EP are identical to the drawings we gave TOR, and the paragraphs of the description are identical to paragraphs of the report we gave to them. TOR-EP has a single claim directed to a machine having a duct for feeding filler at the bottom.[009] TOR-EP   discloses   a   subject-matter   almost   identical   to   the   subject-matter  of OPT-EP1. The only difference is that TOR-EP is silent on the two feeding ducts of OPT-EP1.   TOR-EP   is   also   silent   on   the   water   spray   device   of   OPT-EP2.   A communication of the intention to grant was sent to TOR five days ago.[010]  The second document is one of our own videos showing our prototype FEED machine and explaining how it works. We uploaded the video to our website, where it has been publicly available since 10 July 2019. The prototype machine disclosed in the video has only one feeding duct and no water spray device. According to the opponent, a claim directed to a machine having two feeding ducts is obvious in view of a machine having a single duct.[011]  We received a communication from the Opposition Division dated 3 December 2021inviting us to file a response to the opposition within four months. Please help us to prepare our response. In our opinion, the opposition should be rejected because it was filed by a lawyer who has no interest in the case. [012] There is another surprising advantage of having two ducts for feeding the filler to the bottom of the mill. We recently discovered that when filler in the form of a powder is fed from one duct and filler in the form of granules is fed from a second duct, the blades of the mill remain clean. The granules are made by compacting the filler powder. This feeding process, which we call CLEAN, provides an important advantage because it saves up to 30% of the costs of the recycling process by avoiding the machine having to be stopped in order to clean the blades. Feeding granules only does not provide this advantage.[013] As it is such a valuable development, we want to protect the CLEAN process with a  patent  application.  Before filing  the  application,  we want to  know  the  Opposition Division’s opinion on it. Our idea is to explain this newly discovered advantage of having two ducts when arguing inventive step, in our written response to the opposition.[014] We filed our OPT-PCT application in view of a joint venture we plan to enter with Avidus, an investment fund which will help us to manufacture our own machines and expand our activities in the US, China and India.[015] There is another problem with TOR. Two weeks ago we received a “cease and desist” letter from TOR requesting us to cease any use of our FEED machine with the SPRAY device in view of their European patent TOR-EP-old. TOR-EP-old discloses and claims a water spray device that is identical to the one we make and use in our machine and which is disclosed in OPT-EP2. This water spray device was shown by TOR for a different purpose at a fair in Barcelona in 2014 which we attended. This water spray device was fully disclosed in a brochure with a date on it, which was handed out at the fair and is in our possession.[016] TOR-EP-old was filed in 2015 without claiming priority and was granted in 2017. Avidus  filed  an  opposition  against  TOR-EP-old  on  the  ground  of  insufficiency  of disclosure only. The opposition was rejected and Avidus appealed the decision of the Opposition Division. The appeal is pending.[017] We attempted to contact TOR to resolve the above issues, but TOR refused to talk to us. Avidus informed us that they were contacted by TOR. TOR is using TOR-EP to convince Avidus to replace us with TOR in the joint venture. Avidus told us that if they reach an agreement with TOR, they will withdraw their appeal. We have a meeting with Avidus scheduled for next week, and we need your help on the following points:\n",

      "\tMost candidates realized EP-P2 and EP-P3 were only entitled to partial priority, but a small minority correctly applied the case law of G1/15 in dividing the claimed subject matter. In the aftermath of decision G1/15, the Examination Committee has repeatedly tested partial priority in view of its importance in the practice before the EPO. To the regret of the Examination Committee, it appears that the majority of EQE candidates still cannot successfully apply the principles of G1/15. In this respect, while the range of CO2 concentration was usually addressed, the generalization of spider species was often overlooked. Candidates often missed the invalid priority claim in EP-P3 to EP-P2 for the subject matter which was already disclosed in EP-P1. Even among the candidates who correctly divided the claimed subject matter, there were some who wrongly concluded that EP-P1 was novelty destroying for claim 1 of EP-P2. Few candidates realized that the comparative example, AA [16], was also novelty destroying for claim 1 of EP-P3. The part on EP-AA+ was usually well answered. However, a surprisingly high number of candidates wrongly considered that EP-P2 was a prior art document under Art. 54(3) EPC, despite there was no indication in the paper that EP-P2 was published after the filing date of EP-AA+. The part on PCT-TM+ also quite well answered. However, discussion on the validity of product-by-process claims was often omitted. \n",
      "question 2\n",
      "\tOverall, this question was not well answered by most candidates. Many candidates realized that there was a need to revive a Euro-PCT application after the missed regional phase entry for PCT-TM+. However, the applicable remedies that should be used to revive the application were not always properly identified and the corresponding deadlines correctly computed (e.g. the starting point of the one-year period for re-establishment). In addition, many candidates wrongly concluded that the communication of loss of rights should have been notified to the representative. Among the candidates who discussed the opportunity to extend the geographical scope of protection of PCT-TM+ to Bosnia-Herzegovina, only a small minority recognized how this should be achieved. \n",
      "question 3\n",
      "\ta) Some candidates speculated about possible grounds to oppose EP-P2, presumably because the opposition period had not yet lapsed; however, there was no information in the paper that any ground could be successful. A disappointing number of candidates noted that validation in Switzerland was automatic. In contrast, a good number of the candidates realized that the CO2 concentration used in Spiez (16%) did not fall within the claimed range of EP-P2. b) Some candidates just considered that no rights were available in Turkey, and therefore, did not discuss the fact that the CO2 concentration used in Turkey (8%) falls within the claimed range of EP-P2. c) The majority of candidates correctly acknowledged that there were no patent rights available in the US. d) A fair number of candidates correctly spotted the Art. 64(2) issue for importing in Switzerland. \n",
      "question 4\n",
      "\ta) The candidates who suggested to file third party observations against EP-P3, and the ones who suggested to file an opposition later were awarded the same number of marks. Very few candidates explained why it would not be possible for Prosilk to have protection covering the embodiment used by Xeracno, and concluded that they were free to operate. b) and c) The b) part of this question was poorly answered, whereas the c) part of the question was well answered. d) Very few candidates had the right answer because they simply replicated their answer to question 3 part d) without noticing that no patent right could be achieved on the 8% CO2 concentration and that therefore protection of a product directly obtained by a process was no longer applicable. \n",

      "question 1\n",
      "\tThis question was generally well answered. Most candidates stated that PCT-3 was likely filed in Spanish, as it is an accepted language by the SPTO. Fewer candidates however realized that PCT-3 must have been filed in Spanish, as it is the only language accepted by the SPTO and would otherwise have been transmitted to the IB. Quite a few candidates missed the fact that late filing of the translation is possible or did not calculate the corresponding time limits. Most candidates correctly answered when and where to file amended claims and the rectified description. Some candidates however wrongly concluded that the claim amendments must be filed in the language of translation. Many candidates missed the fact that the rectified description needs to be filed both in the language of the application and in the language of translation. \n",
      "question 2\n",
      "\tMost candidates realized that the examination fee has not been paid and a reply to the written opinion was not filed in time. Some candidates forgot that the designation fee also has to be paid. Many candidates failed to recognize that the application is deemed withdrawn independently for each of the three omitted acts and did not cite all relevant legal bases. Most candidates correctly indicated that further processing was available, but the time limit for it has been missed, so that re-establishment into the period for further processing is the only option. Points were frequently missed due to wrongly calculated time limits. In particular, candidates often did not start the calculation of the 1-year time limit of Rule 136(1) EPC from the missed time limit for further processing. Moreover, the list of acts to be performed was often incomplete or insufficient legal basis was cited. Many candidates forgot to mention renewal fees or did not conclude that renewal fees for the third year will become due on the date of the notification of the decision re-establishing the rights. \n",
      "question 3\n",
      "\tAlthough relating to rather standard matter, this question was not well answered. Most candidates realized that A, not being a resident of a contracting state, needed to appoint a professional representative, and that the representative needed to sign the notice of opposition. Many candidates wrongly argued that the appointed representative will be deemed common representative only because A, who needs representation, is named first. Some candidates realized that the translation of the notice of opposition was timely filed before the expiration of the opposition period, albeit not being validly signed. However, many failed to recognize that, to retain its original date, the accompanying letter needs to be signed by the appointed representative. \n",
      "question 4\n",
      "\tFor many candidates, this question appears to have been the most challenging in Part I. Most candidates realized that EP-D2 and EP-D3 were late filed and will be admitted into the proceedings only if they are prima facie prejudicial to the maintenance of the patent. However, many candidates failed to recognize that EP-D3 is only relevant for claim 4, which is not covered by the extent of the opposition and will therefore not be admitted. Many candidates copied relevant provisions but failed to apply those to the situation at hand. Most candidates correctly suggested filing amended claims relating to subject-matters A+B and A+C. Many candidates did not realize that subject-matter D cannot remain in a valid patent. Of those, who did, the majority missed that, to obtain a valid patent, subject-matter D should be deleted in a limitation procedure after the opposition. \n",
      "question 5\n",
      "\tThis question was generally well answered. Most candidates provided the correct steps and bases needed to validate EP-7 in Poland and the UK, as well as those needed to obtain Unitary Patent protection. Points were mostly lost with respect to when and where renewal fees need to be paid. For example, most candidates overlooked the special provisions for payment of the renewal fees in the UK. Considering that this was the first time a question was asked on Unitary Patent protection, most candidates were well prepared and cited the relevant legal basis. \n",

The renewal fee for the third year was due on 30.11.2023, Rule 51(1) EPC.

CO2 is a different gas.Claim 1 is also inventive because raising spiders in the claimed range of CO2 concentration is not suggested in the prior art, and it avoids cannibalism while solving the safety issues.As a result, claim 1 is patentable and has been correctly granted.EP-P3EP-P3 has the same applicant as in EP-P2 and it has been filed within 12 months.Claim 1 has 2 effective dates due to partial priority:-14 January 2020 for subject matter first disclosed in EP-P2, i.e. for raising species other than AA with [3-9] CO2, and for raising any species with a higher concentration than 9% CO2, for which the priority claim is valid.-15 May 2020 for subject matter AA [3-9] and the comparative example AA [16] whichare first disclosed in EP-P1, and therefore the priority claim from EP-P2 is not valid.-15 May 2020 for remaining subject matter, i.e. for raising any species in the CO2 rangeabove 13%, excluding AA [16], for which priority claim is also not valid as it was not disclosed in EP-P2.EP-P1 is Art. 54(3) document because it was filed before the priority date of EP-P3 and published after.EP-P2 is also Art. 54(3) document for the claimed subject matter not enjoying priority, because it was filed before the filing date of EP-P3 and published after.Claim 1 of EP-P3 lacks novelty over any of EP-P1 and EP-P2, which disclose the comparative example AA [16] and AA [3-9].As a result, EP-P3 as it currently stands should not proceed to grant.EP-AA+No priority is claimed and therefore the effective date for both claims is the filing date.EP-P1 & EP-P2 are comprised in the state of the art under Art. 54(2) EPC, whereas EP-P3 is an Art. 54(3) document.Claim 1 is novel over the prior art due to the presence of N2O.Claim 1 is also inventive because raising spiders in the presence of N2O is not suggested in the prior art, and the presence of N2O leads to an improved silk production.Claim 2 being dependent on claim 1 is novel and inventive for the same reasons.PCT-TM+No priority is claimed and therefore the effective date for both claims is the filing date.Claim 1 is novel because no prior art document discloses a spider diet involving tiger mosquitos.Claim 1 is also inventive because the feeding of spiders with tiger mosquitos is not suggested in the prior art, and such a diet surprisingly increases the spiders’ lifespan.As it currently stands, protection may therefore be expected in the US for claim 1.Claim 2 is a product-by-process claim. The result of the process is still the same spider silk as the one produced according to the prior art.Therefore, claim 2 would not be novel if the regional Euro-PCT phase was entered according to Xeracno’s wish.\n",

      "text : The time limit for entering the European phase for PCT-TM+ expired on 14 November 2023. The time limit for requesting further processing in response to the communication of loss of rights has expired on 14 February 2024.It is possible to request re-establishment of rights in respect of the missed further processing time limit. In the request, it should be explained why the time limit for requesting further processing could not be observed despite all due care having been taken.The omitted acts to enter the European phase have to be completed along with the payment of the further processing fees, as well as the corresponding re-establishment fees.This should be done within 2 months of the removal of the cause of non-compliance, i.e. 4 March 2024, and therefore no later than 6 May 2024. This is within one year from the unobserved time limit for requesting further processing.Additionally, the renewal fee for the third year needs to be paid, and this can be done within four months from the decision re-establishing the rights.As far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned, the time limit of 34 months for entering the national phase was missed. A possibility to get patent protection there is to request extension of the Euro-PCT patent application when completing the omitted acts.The EPO did correctly send the notification of loss of rights to Xeracno instead of SMART SA because the appointment of a representative during the international phase does not imply that it applies also to the Euro-PCT phase.Once Xeracno obtains a European patent, and all the requirements for validation are met in Bosnia-Herzegovina, they will be able to prevent Prosilk from harvesting spider silk with a method comprising feeding of spiders with tiger mosquitos in that country.Claim 2 of PCT-TM+ cannot be granted by the EPO. However, in European countries, Xeracno will be able to prevent Prosilk from selling silk directly obtained by a method falling under the scope of claim 1, such as the one which is planned by Prosilk in Bosnia-Herzegovina.There is nothing that can be done though against the current production of Prosilk in Germanybecause the method of harvesting spider silk by raising AF spiders in a concentration of 19% CO2 cannot be covered by any of Xeracno’s patent applications.\n",

      "('question 1', [{'code': None, 'text': '\\uf0b7 EP-P2EP-P1 is the first application for raising spiders AA in an atmosphere containing from 3% to 9% CO2 (AA [3-9]).EP-P2 has the same applicant as EP-P1 and it has been filed within 12 months.Claim 1 of EP-P2 has 2 effective dates due to partial priority:-16 January 2019 for subject matter AA [3-9] benefiting from the priority of EP-P1, and-14 January 2020 for remaining subject matter, i.e. for raising species other than AA with [3-9] CO2 and for raising any species with a higher concentration than 9% CO2, not benefiting from priority from EP-P1.EP-P1 is a Art. 54(3) document for the part for which priority is invalid, because it was filed before and published after, but is not novelty destroying because it does not disclose it.Claim 1 is novel over the prior art which uses acetylene. CO2 is a different gas.Claim 1 is also inventive because raising spiders in the claimed range of CO2 concentration is not suggested in the prior art, and it avoids cannibalism while solving the safety issues.As a result, claim 1 is patentable and has been correctly granted.\\uf0b7EP-P3EP-P3 has the same applicant as in EP-P2 and it has been filed within 12 months.Claim 1 has 2 effective dates due to partial priority:-14 January 2020 for subject matter first disclosed in EP-P2, i.e. for raising species other than AA with [3-9] CO2, and for raising any species with a higher concentration than 9% CO2, for which the priority claim is valid.-15 May 2020 for subject matter AA [3-9] and the comparative example AA [16] whichare first disclosed in EP-P1, and therefore the priority claim from EP-P2 is not valid.-15 May 2020 for remaining subject matter, i.e. for raising any species in the CO2 rangeabove 13%, excluding AA [16], for which priority claim is also not valid as it was not disclosed in EP-P2.EP-P1 is Art. 54(3) document because it was filed before the priority date of EP-P3 and published after.EP-P2 is also Art. 54(3) document for the claimed subject matter not enjoying priority, because it was filed before the filing date of EP-P3 and published after.Claim 1 of EP-P3 lacks novelty over any of EP-P1 and EP-P2, which disclose the comparative example AA [16] and AA [3-9].As a result, EP-P3 as it currently stands should not proceed to grant.\\uf0b7EP-AA+No priority is claimed and therefore the effective date for both claims is the filing date.EP-P1 & EP-P2 are comprised in the state of the art under Art. 54(2) EPC, whereas EP-P3 is an Art. 54(3) document.Claim 1 is novel over the prior art due to the presence of N2O.Claim 1 is also inventive because raising spiders in the presence of N2O is not suggested in the prior art, and the presence of N2O leads to an improved silk production.Claim 2 being dependent on claim 1 is novel and inventive for the same reasons.\\uf0b7PCT-TM+No priority is claimed and therefore the effective date for both claims is the filing date.Claim 1 is novel because no prior art document discloses a spider diet involving tiger mosquitos.Claim 1 is also inventive because the feeding of spiders with tiger mosquitos is not suggested in the prior art, and such a diet surprisingly increases the spiders’ lifespan.As it currently stands, protection may therefore be expected in the US for claim 1.Claim 2 is a product-by-process claim. The result of the process is still the same spider silk as the one produced according to the prior art.Therefore, claim 2 would not be novel if the regional Euro-PCT phase was entered according to Xeracno’s wish.'}])\n",

The time limit for requesting further processing in response to the communication of loss of rights has expired on 14 February 2024.It is possible to request re-establishment of rights in respect of the missed further processing time limit. In the request, it should be explained why the time limit for requesting further processing could not be observed despite all due care having been taken.The omitted acts to enter the European phase have to be completed along with the payment of the further processing fees, as well as the corresponding re-establishment fees.This should be done within 2 months of the removal of the cause of non-compliance, i.e. 4 March 2024, and therefore no later than 6 May 2024. This is within one year from the unobserved time limit for requesting further processing.Additionally, the renewal fee for the third year needs to be paid, and this can be done within four months from the decision re-establishing the rights.As far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned, the time limit of 34 months for entering the national phase was missed. A possibility to get patent protection there is to request extension of the Euro-PCT patent application when completing the omitted acts.The EPO did correctly send the notification of loss of rights to Xeracno instead of SMART SA because the appointment of a representative during the international phase does not imply that it applies also to the Euro-PCT phase.Once Xeracno obtains a European patent, and all the requirements for validation are met in Bosnia-Herzegovina, they will be able to prevent Prosilk from harvesting spider silk with a method comprising feeding of spiders with tiger mosquitos in that country.Claim 2 of PCT-TM+ cannot be granted by the EPO. However, in European countries, Xeracno will be able to prevent Prosilk from selling silk directly obtained by a method falling under the scope of claim 1, such as the one which is planned by Prosilk in Bosnia-Herzegovina.There is nothing that can be done though against the current production of Prosilk in Germanybecause the method of harvesting spider silk by raising AF spiders in a concentration of 19% CO2 cannot be covered by any of Xeracno’s patent applications.'}])\n",

       " 'context': 'You receive the following e-mail from the firm Optimisme.You receive the following e-mail from the firm Optimisme.Dear Representative,[001] My   name   is   Candide.   I   am   the   General   Manager   of   Italian   company Optimisme (OPT). OPT specialises in plastic recycling. We design our own recycling machines  in-house  and  we  have  them  made  by  Torre  (TOR),  an  Italian  company manufacturing plastic recycling machines. When we started working with TOR in 2018, we signed an agreement. Under this agreement, TOR is bound to secrecy, and all intellectual property generated since then belongs to OPT. In future, we will manufacture these machines ourselves.[002] A known process of recycling includes cutting the plastic waste into small pieces in a mill, i.e. in a container with blades rotating at its bottom. An inorganic filler in the form of a powder is fed to the mill to be mixed with the plastic pieces to increase rigidity of the plastic. The problem with this known machine is that the maximum amount of filler that can be fed to the mill is 10% by weight. If higher amounts are fed to the mill, part of the filler is ejected outside the machine and a lot of dust is generated. Conventionally, to reach 50% by weight of filler, the plastic exiting the mill must be processed with another machine, where more filler is mixed with the plastic.[003] In January 2019, we invented a new machine for recycling plastic. In our machine the filler is fed to the bottom of the mill so that it is mixed with the plastic pieces while the plastic waste is cut. This is a great improvement over the prior techniques: we can feed up to 50% of filler to the plastic in the mill and during the process less dust is generated, so that workers are safer than before.[004]  On 3  June 2019  we gave TOR our  complete technical drawings and a  fully enabling explanatory report to enable them to manufacture our machine, which we called FEED. On 1 July 2019 we received a prototype of the FEED machine with one feeding duct at the bottom of the mill. We modified the FEED machine received from TOR by adding a second feeding duct at the bottom of the mill. We discovered that by using two feeding ducts for the filler, a surprisingly greater uniformity of the recycled plastic  can  be  obtained.  We  filed  a  European  patent  application,  OPT-EP1,  on  22 July 2019. OPT-EP1 discloses and claims a machine comprising at least one duct for feeding filler at the bottom of the mill. OPT-EP1 also discloses the machine with two feeding ducts at the bottom of the mill. This feature is claimed in dependent claim 2.[005] After filing OPT-EP1, we realised that by mounting a special water spray device (SPRAY) on the FEED machine it is possible to reduce the dust generated by the machine,   surprisingly   without   affecting   the   properties   of   the   recycled   plastic. On 4 October 2019, we filed European patent application OPT-EP2 without claiming any priority. OPT-EP2 includes the entire description and claims of OPT-EP1; it additionally discloses the SPRAY device and the FEED machine with the SPRAY device mounted on it.[006]  On 30 September 2020, we filed international application OPT-PCT. OPT-PCT contains  the  entire  description  and  claims  of  OPT-EP2  and  additionally  claims  the SPRAY device per se, and the FEED machine with the SPRAY device mounted on it. OPT-PCT claims priority from OPT-EP2.[007] OPT-EP1   was   granted   as   filed.   The   mention   of   grant   was   published  on 27 January 2021. OPT-EP1 was opposed by a German lawyer. The grounds of opposition are lack of novelty and inventive step based on two documents.[008] The  first  document  is  TOR-EP,  a  European  patent  application  filed  by  TOR  on 3 June 2019. The figures in TOR-EP are identical to the drawings we gave TOR, and the paragraphs of the description are identical to paragraphs of the report we gave to them. TOR-EP has a single claim directed to a machine having a duct for feeding filler at the bottom.[009] TOR-EP   discloses   a   subject-matter   almost   identical   to   the   subject-matter  of OPT-EP1. The only difference is that TOR-EP is silent on the two feeding ducts of OPT-EP1.   TOR-EP   is   also   silent   on   the   water   spray   device   of   OPT-EP2.   A communication of the intention to grant was sent to TOR five days ago.[010]  The second document is one of our own videos showing our prototype FEED machine and explaining how it works. We uploaded the video to our website, where it has been publicly available since 10 July 2019. The prototype machine disclosed in the video has only one feeding duct and no water spray device. According to the opponent, a claim directed to a machine having two feeding ducts is obvious in view of a machine having a single duct.[011]  We received a communication from the Opposition Division dated 3 December 2021inviting us to file a response to the opposition within four months. Please help us to prepare our response. In our opinion, the opposition should be rejected because it was filed by a lawyer who has no interest in the case. [012] There is another surprising advantage of having two ducts for feeding the filler to the bottom of the mill. We recently discovered that when filler in the form of a powder is fed from one duct and filler in the form of granules is fed from a second duct, the blades of the mill remain clean. The granules are made by compacting the filler powder. This feeding process, which we call CLEAN, provides an important advantage because it saves up to 30% of the costs of the recycling process by avoiding the machine having to be stopped in order to clean the blades. Feeding granules only does not provide this advantage.[013] As it is such a valuable development, we want to protect the CLEAN process with a  patent  application.  Before filing  the  application,  we want to  know  the  Opposition Division’s opinion on it. Our idea is to explain this newly discovered advantage of having two ducts when arguing inventive step, in our written response to the opposition.[014] We filed our OPT-PCT application in view of a joint venture we plan to enter with Avidus, an investment fund which will help us to manufacture our own machines and expand our activities in the US, China and India.[015] There is another problem with TOR. Two weeks ago we received a “cease and desist” letter from TOR requesting us to cease any use of our FEED machine with the SPRAY device in view of their European patent TOR-EP-old. TOR-EP-old discloses and claims a water spray device that is identical to the one we make and use in our machine and which is disclosed in OPT-EP2. This water spray device was shown by TOR for a different purpose at a fair in Barcelona in 2014 which we attended. This water spray device was fully disclosed in a brochure with a date on it, which was handed out at the fair and is in our possession.[016] TOR-EP-old was filed in 2015 without claiming priority and was granted in 2017. Avidus  filed  an  opposition  against  TOR-EP-old  on  the  ground  of  insufficiency  of disclosure only. The opposition was rejected and Avidus appealed the decision of the Opposition Division. The appeal is pending.[017] We attempted to contact TOR to resolve the above issues, but TOR refused to talk to us. Avidus informed us that they were contacted by TOR. TOR is using TOR-EP to convince Avidus to replace us with TOR in the joint venture. Avidus told us that if they reach an agreement with TOR, they will withdraw their appeal.

       "    'Examiners’ Report – Paper D 2021, Part II  This year’s Part II of paper D required candidates to analyse a complex patent situation recognising an invalid claim to priority, prior art under Article 54(3) EPC, sufficiency of disclosure, the possibility of a PCT application entering the European phase late, the effect of Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC and the admissibility of submissions in the opposition procedure.  The order of the questions provided a structure for candidates to conduct a complete analysis of the patent situation before considering improvements and consequences. Candidates who followed this structure generally did well in the analysis and spotted most of the relevant issues. Providing the current status of the rights includes an assessment of the validity of those rights. Candidates who immediately proposed improvements without fully analysing the situation as outlined in the paper often missed several relevant issues.  Many candidates recognised that W-IT is not the first application in respect of a SPRINGY leash (S) and a SPRINGY leash with OH-NO fastener (S+O), though in some cases HP-PCT was incorrectly judged to be prior art under Article 54(3) EPC in respect of P-EP or W-EP in spite of not having entered the European phase. Some candidates concluded that the Japanese patent application W-JP constituted prior art for these patents under Article 54(3) EPC leading to incorrect conclusions.  Candidates exhibiting a proper understanding of the interplay between Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC in respect of the subject matter of P-EP answered question 2 well, recognising that the deficiencies in P-EP cannot be remedied in opposition proceedings and P-EP will be revoked. However, a worrying number of candidates suggested amending the claim of P-EP to remove the feature of a sound barrier (B), or replacing or supplementing B with the AHHH modification (A).  A number of candidates surprisingly proposed filing a divisional application on the basis of granted patent P-EP.   In the improvement of the situation, many candidates recognised the opportunity to enter the European phase in HP-PCT using further processing, though few noted the need to for the Chinese co-applicant, HOUND, to appoint a professional representative. - 11 -   When HP-PCT is in the European phase, a number of practical steps are necessary to ensure it is taken into account as prior art under Article 54(3) EPC. Most candidates skipped at least one of these steps. In particular, in addition to requesting the admission of evidence into the procedure citing the regionalised HP-PCT application, it is necessary to evidence the new fact that the subject matters S+O and S+O+C in W-EP have, as effective date, the filing date of W-EP. Candidates often neglected to mention this important fact to show the invalidity of the claims as amended in W-EP. Furthermore, some candidates omitted to request the admission of HP-PCT to the opposition procedure as relevant prior art under Article 54(3) EPC for W-EP.  Additionally, some candidates incorrectly concluded that amended claim 1 of W-EP directed to S+O is novel over the disclosure of a SPRINGY leash with OH-NO fastener and a COMEBACK cable (S+O+C) in HP-PCT in the European phase.  Candidates were generally good at identifying the individual states in which patent protection can be obtained by each of the parties, noting the respective states of interest to the parties, and in summarising the effects of the protection obtained on competitors.   - 12 -   ')],\n",

Art. 6(6) of the Regulation on the European qualifying examination for professional representatives).  General comments  Candidates are reminded that they should pay attention to the way the questions are asked and should not simply repeat information from the paper in the answer. Repeating information per se is not awarded any marks. Alternative answers, one being correct and one being wrong, for the markers to choose from do not attract any marks.  In Part I, full marks were only awarded when the full legal basis was cited to support the analysis. Citing only the legal basis or repeating the text therefrom without any further explanation, reasoning or providing advice generally does not attract any marks. However, alternative relevant legal bases also attracted marks.  An unnecessary amount of points was sometimes lost due to miscalculation of time limits.

A first reason for filing an opposition against EP-C is that there is no certainty that EP-C will be revoked, because revocation proceedings are not pending. A second reason is that the renewal fee to pay to the German Patent and Trademark Office fell due on 30.09.22, but may still be paid with surcharge until 31.03.23, National Law Table VI. Since Germany is a party to the London agreement, EP-C is currently in force in Germany. The renewal fee with surcharge may be paid after the end of the opposition period. Hence, at the end of the opposition period, there will be no guarantee that EP-C will lapse in Germany. A third reason is that, irrespective of whether or not company C lets EP-C lapse by not paying the renewal fees, it is still advisable to file an opposition because a revocation or a limitation in opposition has an ex tunc effect, Art. 68 EPC. If the patent merely lapses, company D may still be sued for having infringed the patent with their products sold between July 2022 and lapse of the patent.'}\n",

Consequently, three requests for re-establishment must be filed and three feesfor re-establishment must be paid, Guidelines E-VIII, 3.1.3.Company C must provide evidence that the failure to observe the time limit resulted from anisolated mistake within a normally satisfactory monitoring system, Guidelines E-VIII, 3.2,which shows that all due care was taken, Rule 136(2) EPC.Company C must further complete the omitted acts for re-establishment, i.e. request furtherprocessing, Article 121(1) EPC and Rule 135(1) EPC, by:- Paying the examination fee, and paying the fee for further processing, i.e. paying theexamination fee with a 50% surcharge, Article 2(1) item 12 RFees;- Paying the designation fee, and paying the fee for further processing, i.e. paying thedesignation fee with a 50% surcharge, Article 2(1) item 12 RFees;- Filing a reply to the search opinion and paying the fee for further processing, Article 2(1)item 12 RFees. The renewal fee for the third year was due on 30.11.2023, Rule 51(1) EPC. Hence, Rule 51(4)(a) EPC applies, i.e. the renewal fee falls due on the date of the notification of the decision re-establishing the rights and may still be paid within four months of that date without anadditional fee.'}\n",
